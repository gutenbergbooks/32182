<p><span class="bold">COQUELIN, BENOÎT CONSTANT<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (1841-1909), French actor,
known as Coquelin <i>aîné</i>, was born at Boulogne on the 23rd of
January 1841. He was originally intended to follow his father&rsquo;s
trade of baker (he was once called <i>un boulanger manqué</i> by a
hostile critic), but his love of acting led him to the Conservatoire,
where he entered Regnier&rsquo;s class in 1859. He won the first prize
for comedy within a year, and made his début on the 7th of
December 1860 at the Comédie Française as the comic valet,
Gros-René, in Molière&rsquo;s <i>Dépit amoureux</i>, but his first great success
was as Figaro, in the following year. He was made <i>sociétaire</i> in
1864, and during the next twenty-two years he created at the
Français the leading parts in forty-four new plays, including
Théodore de Banville&rsquo;s <i>Gringoire</i> (1867), Paul Ferrier&rsquo;s <i>Tabarin</i>
(1871), Émile Augier&rsquo;s <i>Paul Forestier</i> (1871), <i>L&rsquo;Étrangère</i> (1876)
by the younger Dumas, Charles Lomon&rsquo;s <i>Jean Dacier</i> (1877),
Edward Pailleron&rsquo;s <i>Le Monde où l&rsquo;on s&rsquo;ennuie</i> (1881), Erckmann
and Chatrian&rsquo;s <i>Les Rantzau</i> (1884). In consequence of a dispute
with the authorities over the question of his right to make
provincial tours in France he resigned in 1886. Three years later,
however, the breach was healed; and after a successful series of
tours in Europe and the United States he rejoined the Comédie
Française as <i>pensionnaire</i> in 1890. It was during this period that
he took the part of Labussière, in the production of Sardou&rsquo;s&rsquo;
<i>Thermidor</i>, which was interdicted by the government after three
performances. In 1892 he broke definitely with the Comédie
Française, and toured for some time through the capitals of
Europe with a company of his own. In 1895 he joined the
Renaissance theatre in Paris, and played there until he became
director of the Porte Saint Martin in 1897. Here he won successes
in Edmond Rostand&rsquo;s <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i> (1897), Émile Bergerat&rsquo;s
<i>Plus que reine</i> (1899), Catulle Mendès&rsquo; <i>Scarron</i> (1905), and
Alfred Capus and Lucien Descaves&rsquo; <i>L&rsquo;Attentat</i> (1906). In 1900 he
toured in America with Sarah Bernhardt, and on their return
continued with his old colleague to appear in <i>L&rsquo;Aiglon</i>, at the
Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt. He was rehearsing for the creation
of the leading part in Rostand&rsquo;s <i>Chantecler</i>, which he was to
produce, when he died suddenly in Paris, on the 27th of January
1909. Coquelin was an Officier de l&rsquo;Instruction Publique and of
the Legion of Honour. He published <i>L&rsquo;Art et le comédien</i> (1880),
<i>Molière et le misanthrope</i> (1881), essays on <i>Eugène Manuel</i> (1881)
and <i>Sully-Prudhomme</i> (1882), <i>L&rsquo;Arnolphe de Molière</i> (1882),
<i>Les Comédiens</i> (1882), <i>L&rsquo;Art de dire le monologue</i> (with his
brother, 1884), <i>Tartuffe</i> (1884), <i>L&rsquo;Art du comédien</i> (1894).</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Ernest Alexandre Honoré Coquelin</span> (1848-1909),
called Coquelin <i>cadet</i>, was born on the 16th of May 1848 at
Boulogne, and entered the Conservatoire in 1864. He graduated
with the first prize in comedy and made his début in 1867 at the
Odéon. The next year he appeared with his brother at the
Théâtre Francais and became a <i>sociétaire</i> in 1879. He played a
great many parts, in both the classic and the modern répertoire,
and also had much success in reciting monologues of his own
composition. He wrote <i>Le Livre des convalescents</i> (1880), <i>Le
Monologue moderne</i> (1881), <i>Fairiboles</i> (1882), <i>Le Rire</i> (1887),
<i>Pirouettes</i> (1888). He died on the 8th of February 1909.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean Coquelin</span> (1865-&emsp;&emsp;), son of Coquelin <i>aîné</i>, was also
an actor, first at the Théâtre Francais (début, 1890), later at the
Renaissance, and then at the Porte Saint Martin, where he created
the part of Raigoné in <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COQUEREL, ATHANASE JOSUÉ<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> (1820-1875), French
Protestant divine, son of A. L. C. Coquerel (q.v.), was born at
Amsterdam on the 16th of June 1820. He studied theology
at Geneva and at Strassburg, and at an early age succeeded
his uncle, C. A. Coquerel, as editor of <i>Le Lien</i>, a post which he
held till 1870. In 1852 he took part in establishing the <i>Nouvelle
Revue de théologie</i>, the first periodical of scientific theology
published in France, and in the same year helped to found the
&ldquo;Historical Society of French Protestantism.&rdquo; Meanwhile
he had gained a high reputation as a preacher, and especially
as the advocate of religious freedom; but his teaching became
more and more offensive to the orthodox party, and on the
appearance (1864) of his article on Renan&rsquo;s <i>Vie de Jésus</i> in the
<i>Nouvelle Revue de théologie</i> he was forbidden by the Paris consistory
to continue his ministerial functions. He received an
address of sympathy from the consistory of Anduze, and a
provision was voted for him by the Union Protestante Libérale,
to enable him to continue his preaching. He received the cross
of the Legion of Honour in 1862. He died at Fismes (Marne),
on the 24th of July 1875. His chief works were <i>Jean Calas et
sa famille</i> (1858); <i>Des Beaux-Arts en Italie</i> (Eng. trans. 1859);
<i>La Saint Barthélemy</i> (1860); <i>Précis de l&rsquo;église réformée</i> (1862);

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COQUEREL, ATHANASE LAURENT CHARLES<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (1795-1868),
French Protestant divine, was born in Paris on the 17th of
August 1795. He received his early education from his aunt,
Helen Maria Williams, an Englishwoman, who at the close of the
18th century gained a reputation by various translations and
by her <i>Letters from France</i>. He completed his theological studies
at the Protestant seminary of Montauban, and in 1816 was
ordained minister. In 1817 he was invited to become pastor
of the chapel of St Paul at Jersey, but he declined, being unwilling
to subscribe to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England.
During the following twelve years he resided in Holland, and
preached before Calvinistic congregations at Amsterdam,
Leiden and Utrecht. In 1830, at the suggestion of Baron Georges
de Cuvier, then minister of Protestant worship, Coquerel was
called to Paris as pastor of the Reformed Church. In the course
of 1833 he was chosen a member of the consistory, and rapidly
acquired the reputation of a great pulpit orator, but his liberal
views brought him into antagonism with the rigid Calvinists.
He took a warm interest in all matters of education, and distinguished
himself so much by his defence of the university of
Paris against a sharp attack, that in 1835 he was chosen a
member of the consistory of the Legion of Honour. In 1841
appeared his <i>Réponse</i> to the <i>Leben Jesu</i> of Strauss. After the
revolution of February 1848, Coquerel was elected a member
of the National Assembly, where he sat as a moderate republican,
subsequently becoming a member of the Legislative Assembly.
He supported the first ministry of Louis Napoleon, and gave
his vote in favour of the expedition to Rome and the restoration
of the temporal power of the pope. After the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the
2nd of December 1851, he confined himself to the duties of his
pastorate. He was a prolific writer, as well as a popular and
eloquent speaker. He died at Paris on the 10th of January 1868.
A large collection of his sermons was published in 8 vols. between
1819 and 1852. Other works were <i>Biographie sacrée</i> (1825-1826);
<i>Histoire sainte et analyse de la Bible</i> (1839); <i>Orthodoxie moderne</i>
(1842); <i>Christologie</i> (1858), &amp;c.</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Charles Augustin Coquerel</span> (1797-1851), was
the author of a work on English literature (1828), an <i>Essai sur
l&rsquo;histoire générale du christianisme</i> (1828) and a <i>Histoire des
églises du désert, depuis la revocation de l&rsquo;édit de Nantes</i> (1841).
A liberal in his views, he was the founder and editor of the <i>Annales
protestantes</i>, <i>Le Lien</i>, and the <i>Revue protestante</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COQUES<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Cocx</span>), <span class="bold">GONZALEZ</span> (1614-1684), Flemish painter,
son of Pieter Willemsen Cocx, a respectable Flemish citizen, and
not, as his name might imply, a Spaniard, was born at Antwerp.
At the age of twelve he entered the house of Pieter, the son of
&ldquo;Hell&rdquo; Breughel, an obscure portrait painter, and at the
expiration of his time as an apprentice became a journeyman
in the workshop of David Ryckaert the second, under whom
he made accurate studies of still life. At twenty-six he matriculated
in the gild of St Luke; he then married Ryckaert&rsquo;s
daughter, and in 1653 joined the literary and dramatic club
known as the &ldquo;Retorijkerkamer.&rdquo; After having been made
president of his gild in 1665, and in 1671 painter in ordinary to
Count Monterey, governor-general of the Low Countries, he
married again in 1674, and died full of honours in his native
place. One of his canvases in the gallery at the Hague represents
a suite of rooms hung with pictures, in which the artist himself
may be seen at a table with his wife and two children, surrounded
by masterpieces composed and signed by several contemporaries.
Partnership in painting was common amongst the small masters
of the Antwerp school; and it has been truly said of Coques
that he employed Jacob von Arthois for landscapes, Ghering
and van Ehrenberg for architectural backgrounds, Steenwijck
the younger for rooms, and Pieter Gysels for still life and flowers;
but the model upon which Coques formed himself was Van Dyck,
whose sparkling touch and refined manner he imitated with great
success. He never ventured beyond the &ldquo;cabinet,&rdquo; but in this
limited field the family groups of his middle time are full of life,
brilliant from the sheen of costly dress and sparkling play of
light and shade, combined with finished execution and enamelled
surface.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COQUET<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> (pronounced Cócket), a river of Northumberland,
draining a beautiful valley about 40 m. in length. It rises in
the Cheviot Hills. Following a course generally easterly, but
greatly winding, it passes Harbottle, near which relics of the Stone
Age are seen, and Holystone, where it is recorded that Bishop
Paulinus baptized a great body of Northumbrians in the year
627. Several earthworks crown hills above this part of the valley,
and at Cartington, Fosson and Whitton are relics of medieval
border fortifications. The small town of Rothbury is beautifully
situated beneath the ragged Simonside Hills. The river dashes
through a narrow gully called the Thrum, and then passes Brinkburn
priory, of which the fine Transitional Norman church was
restored to use in 1858, while there are fragments of the monastic
buildings. This was an Augustinian foundation of the time of
Henry I. The dale continues well wooded and very beautiful
until Warkworth is reached, with its fine castle and remarkable
hermitage. A short distance below this the Coquet has its mouth
in Alnwick Bay (North Sea), with the small port of Amble on the
south bank, and Coquet Island a mile out to sea. The river is
frequented by sportsmen for salmon and trout fishing. No
important tributary is received, and the drainage area does not
exceed 240 sq. m.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COQUET<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (pronounced co-kétte), to simulate the arts of love-making,
generally from motives of personal vanity, to flirt; in
a figurative sense, to trifle or dilly-dally with anything. The
word is derived from the French <i>coqueter</i>, which originally means,
&ldquo;to strut about like a cock-bird,&rdquo; i.e. when it desires to attract
the hens. The French substantive <i>coquet</i>, in the sense of &ldquo;beau&rdquo;
or &ldquo;lady-killer,&rdquo; was formerly commonly used in English; but
the feminine form, <i>coquette</i>, now practically alone survives, in the
sense of a woman who gratifies her vanity by using her powers
of attraction in a frivolous or inconstant fashion. Hence &ldquo;to
coquet,&rdquo; the original and more correct form, has come frequently
to be written &ldquo;to coquette.&rdquo; Coquetry (Fr. <i>coquetterie</i>),
primarily the art of the coquette, is used figuratively of any
dilly-dallying or &ldquo;coquetting&rdquo; and, by transference of idea,
of any superficial qualities of attraction in persons or things.
&ldquo;Coquet&rdquo; is still also occasionally used adjectivally, but
the more usual form is &ldquo;coquettish&rdquo;; e.g. we speak of a
&ldquo;coquettish manner,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;coquettish hat.&rdquo; The crested
humming-birds of the genus <i>Lophornis</i> are known as coquettes
(Fr. <i>coquets</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COQUIMBO,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> an important city and port of the province and
department of Coquimbo, Chile, in 29° 57&prime; 4&Prime; S., 71° 21&prime; 12&Prime; W.
Pop. (1895) 7322. The railway connexions are with Ovalle to
the S., and Vicuña (or Elqui) to the E., but the proposed extension
northward of Chile&rsquo;s longitudinal system would bring
Coquimbo into direct communication with Santiago. The city
has a good well-sheltered harbour, reputed the best in northern
Chile, and is the port of La Serena, the provincial capital, 9 m.
distant, with which it is connected by rail. There are large
copper-smelting establishments in the city, which exports a
very large amount of copper, some gold and silver, and cattle
and hay to the more northern provinces.</p>

<p>The province of Coquimbo, which lies between those of
Aconcagua and Atacama and extends from the Pacific inland
to the Argentine frontier, has an area of 13,461 sq. m. (official
estimate) and a population (1895) of 160,898. It is less arid
than the province of Atacama, the surface near the coast being
broken by well-watered river valleys, which produce alfalfa,
and pasture cattle for export. Near the mountains grapes are
grown, from which wine of a good quality is made. The mineral
resources include extensive deposits of copper, and some less
important mines of gold and silver. The climate is dry and
healthy, and there are occasional rains. Several rivers, the
largest of which is the Coquimbo (or Elqui) with a length of
125 m., cross the province from the mountains. The capital is
La Serena, and the principal cities are Coquimbo, Ovalle (pop.
5565), and Illapel (3170).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORACLE<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (Welsh <i>corwg-l</i>, from <i>corwg</i>, cf. Irish and mod. Gaelic
<i>curach</i>, boat), a species of ancient British fishing-boat which is
still extensively used on the Severn and other rivers of Wales,
notably on the Towy and Teifi. It is a light boat, oval in shape,
and formed of canvas stretched on a framework of split and
interwoven rods, and well-coated with tar and pitch to render
it water-tight. According to early writers the framework was
covered with horse or bullock hide (<i>corium</i>). So light and
portable are these boats that they can easily be carried on the
fisherman&rsquo;s shoulders when proceeding to and from his work.
Coracle-fishing is performed by two men, each seated in his
coracle and with one hand holding the net while with the other
he plies his paddle. When a fish is caught, each hauls up his
end of the net until the two coracles are brought to touch and
the fish is then secured. The coracle forms a unique link
between the modern life of Wales and its remote past; for this
primitive type of boat was in existence amongst the Britons
at the time of the invasion of Julius Caesar, who has left a
description of it, and even employed it in his Spanish campaign.</p>

Coray</span>] (1748-1833), Greek scholar and patriot, was born at
Smyrna, the son of a merchant. As a schoolboy he distinguished
himself in the study of ancient Greek, but from 1772 to 1779
he was occupied with the management of his father&rsquo;s business
affairs in Amsterdam. In 1782, on the collapse of his father&rsquo;s
business, he went to Montpellier, where for six years he studied
medicine, supporting himself by translating German and English
medical works into French. He then settled in Paris, where
he lived until his death on the 10th of April 1833. Inspired
by the ideals of the French Revolution, he devoted himself to
furthering the cause of Greek independence both among the
Greeks themselves and by awakening the interest of the chief
European Powers against the Turkish rule. His great object
was to rouse the enthusiasm of the Greeks for the idea that they
were the true descendants of the ancient Hellenes by teaching
them to regard as their own inheritance the great works of
antiquity. He sought to purify the ordinary written language
by eliminating the more obvious barbarisms, and by enriching
it with classical words and others invented in strict accordance
with classical tradition (see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Language</a></span>: <i>modern</i>).
Under his influence, though the common patois was practically
untouched, the language of literature and intellectual intercourse
was made to approximate to the pure Attic of the 5th
and 4th centuries B.C. His chief works are his editions of Greek
authors contained in his <span class="grk" title="Hellênikê Bibliothêkê">&#904;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#914;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#951;</span> and his <span class="grk" title="Parerga">&#928;&#940;&#961;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#945;</span>;
his editions of the <i>Characters</i> of Theophrastus, of the <i>De aëre,
aquis, et locis</i> of Hippocrates, and of the <i>Aethiopica</i> of Heliodorus,
elaborately annotated.</p>

<p>His literary remains have been edited by Mamoukas and Damalas

of the French Revolution have been published (in English, by P. Ralli,

<p><span class="bold">CORAL,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> the hard skeletons of various marine organisms. It
is chiefly carbonate of lime, and is secreted from sea-water
and deposited in the tissues of Anthozoan polyps, the principal
source of the coral-reefs of the world (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Anthozoa</a></span>), of Hydroids
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hydromedusae</a></span>), less important in modern reef-building,
but extremely abundant in Palaeozoic times, and of certain
Algae. The skeletons of many other organisms, such as Polyzoa
and Mollusca, contribute to coral masses but cannot be included
in the term &ldquo;coral.&rdquo; The structure of coral animals (sometimes
erroneously termed &ldquo;coral insects&rdquo;) is dealt within the articles
cited above; for the distribution and formation of reefs see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coral-reefs</a></span>.</p>

<p>Beyond their general utility and value as sources of lime,
few of the corals present any special feature of industrial importance,
excepting the red or precious coral (<i>Corallium rubrum</i>)
of the Mediterranean Sea. It, however, is and has been from
remote times very highly prized for jewelry, personal ornamentation
and decorative purposes generally. About the
beginning of the Christian era a great trade was carried on in
coral between the Mediterranean and India, where it was highly
esteemed as a substance endowed with mysterious sacred
properties. It is remarked by Pliny that, previous to the
existence of the Indian demand, the Gauls were in the habit
of using it for the ornamentation of their weapons of war and
helmets; but in his day, so great was the Eastern demand, that
it was very rarely seen even in the regions which produced it.
Among the Romans branches of coral were hung around children&rsquo;s
necks to preserve them from danger, and the substance had
many medicinal virtues attributed to it. A belief in its potency
as a charm continued to be entertained throughout medieval
times; and even to the present day in Italy it is worn as a
preservative from the evil eye, and by females as a cure for
sterility.</p>

<p>The precious coral is found widespread on the borders and
around the islands of the Mediterranean Sea. It ranges in
depth from shallow water (25 to 50 ft.) to water over 1000 ft.,
but the most abundant beds are in the shallower areas. The
most important fisheries extend along the coasts of Tunisia,
Algeria and Morocco; but red coral is also obtained in the
vicinity of Naples, near Leghorn and Genoa, and on the coasts
of Sardinia, Corsica, Catalonia and Provence. It occurs also
in the Atlantic off the north-west of Africa, and recently it
has been dredged in deep water off the west of Ireland. Allied
species of small commercial value have been obtained off
Mauritius and near Japan. The black coral (<i>Antipathes abies</i>),
formerly abundant in the Persian Gulf, and for which India is
the chief market, has a wide distribution and grows to a considerable
height and thickness in the tropical waters of the
Great Barrier Reef of Australia.</p>

<p>From the middle ages downwards the securing of the right
to the coral fisheries on the African coasts was an object of
considerable rivalry among the Mediterranean communities of
Europe. Previous to the 16th century they were controlled by
the Italian republics. For a short period the Tunisian fisheries
were secured by Charles V. to Spain; but the monopoly soon
fell into the hands of the French, who held the right till the
Revolutionary government in 1793 threw the trade open. For
a short period (about 1806) the British government controlled
the fisheries, and now they are again in the hands of the French
authorities. Previous to the French Revolution much of the coral
trade centred in Marseilles; but since that period, both the
procuring of the raw material and the working of it up into the
various forms in which it is used have become peculiarly Italian
industries, centring largely in Naples, Rome and Genoa. On
the Algerian coast, however, boats not flying the French flag
have to pay heavy dues for the right to fish, and in the early
years of the 20th century the once flourishing fisheries at La
Calle were almost entirely neglected. Two classes of boats
engage in the pursuit&mdash;a large size of from 12 to 14 tons, manned
by ten or twelve hands, and a small size of 3 or 4 tons, with a
crew of five or six. The large boats, dredging from March to
October, collect from 650 to 850 &#8468; of coral, and the small,
working throughout the year, collect from 390 to 500 &#8468;. The
Algerian reefs are divided into ten portions, of which only one
is fished annually&mdash;ten years being considered sufficient for the
proper growth of the coral.</p>

<p>The range of value of the various qualities of coral, according
to colour and size, is exceedingly wide, and notwithstanding the
steady Oriental demand its price is considerably affected by the
fluctuations of fashion. While the price of the finest tints of rose
pink may range from £80 to £120 per oz., ordinary red-coloured
small pieces sell for about £2 per oz., and the small fragments
called <i>collette</i>, used for children&rsquo;s necklaces, cost about 5s. per
oz. In China large spheres of good coloured coral command high
prices, being in great requisition for the button of office worn by
the mandarins. It also finds a ready market throughout India
and in Central Asia; and with the negroes of Central Africa and
of America it is a favourite ornamental substance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORALLIAN<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (Fr. <i>Corallien</i>), in geology, the name of one of the
divisions of the Jurassic rocks. The rocks forming this division
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
are mainly calcareous grits with oolites, and rubbly coral rock&mdash;often
called &ldquo;Coral Rag&rdquo;; ferruginous beds are fairly common,
and occasionally there are beds of clay. In England the Corallian
strata are usually divided into an upper series, characterized by
the ammonite <i>Perisphinctes plicatilis</i>, and a lower series with
<i>Aspidoceras perarmatus</i> as the zonal fossil. When well developed
these beds are seen to lie above the Oxford Clay and below the
Kimeridge Clay; but it will save a good deal of confusion if it is
recognized that the Corallian rocks of England are nothing more
than a variable, local lithological phase of the two clays which
come respectively above and below them. This caution is
particularly necessary when any attempt is being made to
co-ordinate the English with the continental Corallian.</p>

<p>The Corallian rocks are nowhere better displayed than in the
cliffs at Weymouth. Here Messrs Blake and Huddleston recognized
the following beds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">In Dorsetshire the Corallian rocks are 200 ft. thick, in Wiltshire
100 ft., but N.E. of Oxford they are represented mainly by clays,
and the series is much thinner. (At Upware, the &ldquo;Upware
limestone&rdquo; is the only known occurrence of beds that correspond
in character with the Coralline oolite between Wiltshire and
Yorkshire). In Yorkshire, however, the hard rocky beds come
on again in full force. They appear once more at Brora in
Sutherlandshire. Corallian strata have been proved by boring
in Sussex (241 ft.). In Huntingdon, Bedfordshire, parts of
Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire the
Corallian series is represented by the &ldquo;Ampthill Clay,&rdquo; which
has also been called &ldquo;Bluntesham&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tetworth&rdquo; Clay. Here
and there in this district hard calcareous inconstant beds appear,
such as the Elsworth rock, St Ives rock and Boxworth rock.</p>

<p>These rocks play an important part in the formation of the
Vale of Pickering, and the Hambleton and Howardian Hills;
they are well exposed in Gristhorpe Bay.</p>

<p>The passage beds, highly siliceous, flaggy limestones, are known
locally as &ldquo;Greystone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wall stones&rdquo;; some portions of
these beds have resisted the weathering agencies and stand up
prominently on the moors&mdash;such are the &ldquo;Bridestones.&rdquo; Cement
stone beds occur in the upper calcareous grit at North Grimstone;
and in the middle and lower calcareous grits good building stones
are found.</p>

<p>Among the fossils in the English Corallian rocks corals play
an important part, frequently forming large calcareous masses
or &ldquo;doggers&rdquo;; <i>Thamnastrea</i>, <i>Thecosmilia</i> and <i>Isastrea</i> are
prominent genera. Ammonites and belemnites are abundant
and gasteropods are very common (<i>Nerinea</i>, <i>Chemnitzia</i>, <i>Bourgetia</i>,
&amp;c.). <i>Trigonias</i> are very numerous in certain beds (<i>T. perlata</i> and
<i>T. mariani</i>). <i>Astarte ovata</i>, <i>Lucina aliena</i> and other pelecypods
are also abundant. The echinoderms <i>Echinobrissus scutatus</i> and
<i>Cidaris florigemma</i> are characteristic of these beds.</p>

<p>Rocks of the same age as the English Corallian are widely
spread over Europe, but owing to the absence of clearly-marked
stratigraphical and palaeontological boundaries, the nomenclature
has become greatly involved, and there is now a tendency
amongst continental geologists to omit the term Corallian
altogether. According to A. de Lapparent&rsquo;s classification the
English Corallian rocks are represented by the <i>Séquanien</i> stage,
with two substages, an upper <i>Astartien</i> and lower <i>Rauracien</i>;
but this does not include the whole Corallian stage as defined
above, the lower part being placed by the French author in his
<i>Oxfordien</i> stage. For the table showing the relative position of
these stages see the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jurassic</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORAL-REEFS.<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> Many species of coral (q.v.) are widely
distributed, and are found at all depths both in warmer and colder
seas. <i>Lophohelia prolifera</i> and <i>Dendrophyllia ramea</i> form dense
beds at a depth of from 100 to 200 fathoms off the coasts of
Norway, Scotland and Portugal, and the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; and other
deep-sea dredging expeditions have brought up corals from great
depths in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. But the larger
number of species, particularly the more massive kinds, occur
only in tropical seas in shallow waters, whose mean temperature
does not fall below 68° Fahr., and they do not flourish unless
the temperature is considerably higher. These conditions of
temperature are found in a belt of ocean which may roughly be
indicated as lying between the 28th N. and S. parallels. Within
these limits there are numerous reefs and islands formed of coral
intermixed with the calcareous skeletons of other animals, and
their formation has long been a matter of dispute among
naturalists and geologists.</p>

<p>Coral formations may be classed as fringing or shore reefs,
barrier reefs and atolls. <i>Fringing reefs</i> are platforms of coral
rock extending no great distance from the shores of a continent
or island. The seaward edge of the platform is usually somewhat
higher than the inner part, and is often awash at low water.
It is intersected by numerous creeks and channels, especially
opposite those places where streams of fresh water flow down
from the land, and there is usually a channel deep enough to be
navigable by small boats between the edge of the reef and the
land. The outer wall of the reef is rather steep, but descends
into a comparatively shallow sea. Since corals are killed by
fresh water or by deposition of mud or sand, it is obvious that
the outer edge of the reef is the region of most active coral growth,
and the boat channel and the passages leading into it from the
open sea have been formed by the suppression of coral growth
by one of the above-mentioned causes, assisted by the scour
of the tides and the solvent action of sea-water. <i>Barrier reefs</i>
may be regarded as fringing reefs on a large scale. The great
Australian barrier reef extends for no less a distance than 1250 m.
from Torres Strait in 9.5° S. lat. to Lady Elliot island in 24° S.
lat. The outer edge of a barrier reef is much farther from the
shore than that of a fringing reef, and the channel between it and
the land is much deeper. Opposite Cape York the seaward edge
of the great Australian barrier reef is nearly 90 m. distant from
the coast, and the maximum depth of the channel at this point
is nearly 20 fathoms. As is the case in a fringing reef, the outer
edge of a barrier reef is in many places awash at low tides, and
masses of dead coral and sand may be piled up on it by the action
of the waves, so that islets are formed which in time are covered
with vegetation. These islets may coalesce and form a strip
of dry land lying some hundred yards or less from the extreme
outer edge of the reef, and separated by a wide channel from the
mainland. Where the barrier reef is not far from the land there
are always gaps in it opposite the mouths of rivers or considerable
streams. The outer wall of a barrier reef is steep, and frequently,
though not always, descends abruptly into great depths. In
many cases in the Pacific Ocean a barrier reef surrounds one or
more island peaks, and the strips of land on the edge of the reef
may encircle the peaks with a nearly complete ring. An <i>atoll</i>
is a ring-shaped reef, either awash at low tide or surmounted by
several islets, or more rarely by a complete strip of dry land
surrounding a central lagoon. The outer wall of an atoll generally
descends with a very steep but irregular slope to a depth of 500
fathoms or more, but the lagoon is seldom more than 20 fathoms
deep, and may be much less. Frequently, especially to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
leeward side of an atoll, there may be one or more navigable
passages leading from the lagoon to the open sea.</p>

<p>Though corals flourish everywhere under suitable conditions in
tropical seas, coral reefs and atolls are by no means universal in the
torrid zone. The Atlantic Ocean is remarkably free from coral
formations, though there are numerous reefs in the West Indian
islands, off the south coast of Florida, and on the coast of Brazil.
The Bermudas also are coral formations, their high land being
formed by sand accumulated by the wind and cemented into
rock, and are remarkable for being the farthest removed from the
equator of any recent reefs, being situated in 32° N. lat. In the
Pacific Ocean there is a vast area thickly dotted with coral
formations, extending from 5° N. lat. to 25° S. lat., and from 130°
E. long, to 145° W. long. There are also extensive reefs in the
westernmost islands of the Hawaiian group in about 25° N. lat.
In the Indian Ocean, the Laccadive and Maldive islands are
large groups of atolls off the west and south-west of India. Still
farther south is the Chagos group of atolls, and there are numerous
reefs off the north coast of Madagascar, at Mauritius, Bourbon and
the Seychelles. The Cocos-Keeling Islands, in 12° S. lat. and 96° E.
long., are typical atolls in the eastern part of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The remarkable characters of barrier reefs and atolls, their isolated
position in the midst of the great oceans the seemingly unfathomable
depths from which they rise their peaceful and shallow
lagoons and inner channels, their narrow strips of land covered
with coco-nut palms and other vegetation, and rising but a few
feet above the level of the ocean, naturally attracted the attention
of the earlier navigators, who formed sundry speculations as to
their origin. The poet-naturalist, A. von Chamisso, was the first
to propound a definite theory of the origin of atolls and encircling
reefs, attributing their peculiar features to the natural growth of
corals and the action of the waves. He pointed out that the
larger and more massive species of corals flourish best on the
outer sides of a reef, whilst the more interior corals are killed or
stunted in growth by the accumulation of coral and other debris.
Thus the outer edge of a submerged reef is the first to reach the
surface, and a ring of land being formed by materials piled up by
the waves, an atoll with a central lagoon is produced. Chamisso&rsquo;s
theory necessarily assumed the existence of a great number of
submerged banks reaching nearly, but not quite, to the surface of
the sea in the Pacific and Indian oceans, and the difficulty of
accounting for the existence of so many of these led C. Darwin to
reject his views and bring forward an explanation which may be
called the theory of <i>subsidence</i>. Starting from the well-known
premise that reef-building species of corals do not flourish in a
greater depth of water than 20 fathoms, Darwin argued that all
coral islands must have a rocky base, and that it was inconceivable
that, in such large tracts of sea as occur in the Pacific and Indian
oceans, there should be a vast number of submarine peaks or
banks all rising to within 20 or 30 fathoms of the surface and none
emerging above it. But on the supposition that the atolls and
encircling reefs were formed round land which was undergoing
a slow movement of subsidence, their structure could easily be
explained. Take the case of an island consisting of a single high
peak. At first the coral growth would form a fringing reef
clinging to its shores. As the island slowly subsided into the
ocean the upward growth of coral would keep the outer rim of
the reef level with or within a few fathoms of the surface, so that,
as subsidence proceeded, the distance between the outer rim of
the reef and the sinking land would continually increase, with the
result that a barrier-reef would be formed separated by a wide
channel from the central peak. As corals and other organisms
with calcareous skeletons live in the channel, their remains, as well
as the accumulation of coral and other debris thrown over the
outer edge of the reef, would maintain the channel at a shallower
depth than that of the ocean outside. Finally, if the subsidence
continued, the central peak would disappear beneath the surface,
and an atoll would be left consisting of a raised margin of reef
surrounding a central lagoon, and any pause during the movement
of subsidence would result in the formation of raised islets or
a strip of dry land along the margin of the reef. Darwin&rsquo;s
theory was published in 1842, and found almost universal
acceptance, both because of its simplicity and its applicability to
every known type of coral-reef formation, including such difficult
cases as the Great Chagos Bank, a huge submerged atoll in the
Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Darwin&rsquo;s theory was adopted and strengthened by J. D. Dana,
who had made extensive observations among the Pacific coral
reefs between 1838 and 1842, but it was not long before it was
attacked by other observers. In 1851 Louis Agassiz produced
evidence to show that the reefs off the south coast of Florida were
not formed during subsidence, and in 1863 Karl Semper showed
that in the Pelew islands there is abundant evidence of recent
upheaval in a region where both atolls and barrier-reefs exist.
Latterly, many instances of recently upraised coral formations
have been described by H. B. Guppy, J. S. Gardiner and others,
and Alexander Agassiz and Sir J. Murray have brought forward
a mass of evidence tending to shake the subsidence theory to its
foundations. Murray has pointed out that the deep-sea soundings
of the &ldquo;Tuscarora&rdquo; and &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; have proved the
existence of a large number of submarine elevations rising out of a
depth of 2000 fathoms or more to within a few hundred fathoms
of the surface. The existence of such banks was unknown to
Darwin, and removes his objections to Chamisso&rsquo;s theory. For
although they may at first be too far below the surface for reef-building
corals, they afford a habitat for numerous echinoderms,
molluscs, crustacea and deep-sea corals, whose skeletons
accumulate on their summits, and they further receive a constant
rain of the calcareous and silicious skeletons of minute organisms
which teem in the waters above. By these agencies the banks are
gradually raised to the lowest depth at which reef-building
corals can flourish, and once these establish themselves they will
grow more rapidly on the periphery of the bank, because they are
more favourably situated as regards food-supply. Thus the reef
will rise to the surface as an atoll, and the nearer it approaches
the surface the more will the corals on the exterior faces be
favoured, and the more will those in the centre of the reef decrease,
for experiment has shown that the minute pelagic organisms on
which corals feed are far less abundant in a lagoon than in the sea
outside. Eventually, as the margin of the reef rises to the surface
and material is accumulated upon it to form islets or continuous
land, the coral growth in the lagoon will be feeble, and the solvent
action of sea-water and the scour of the tide will tend to deepen the
lagoon. Thus the considerable depth of some lagoons, amounting
to 40 or 50 fathoms, may be accounted for. The observations of
Guppy in the Solomon islands have gone far to confirm Murray&rsquo;s
conclusions, since he found in the islands of Ugi, Santa Anna and
Treasury and Stirling islands unmistakable evidences of a nucleus
of volcanic rock, covered with soft earthy bedded deposits
several hundred feet thick. These deposits are highly fossiliferous
in parts, and contain the remains of pteropods, lamellibranchs
and echinoderms, embedded in a foraminiferous deposit
mixed with volcanic debris, like the deep-sea muds brought up by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
the &ldquo;Challenger.&rdquo; The flanks of these elevated beds are covered
with coralline limestone rocks varying from 100 to 16 ft. in
thickness. One of the islands, Santa Anna, has the form of an
upraised atoll, with a mass of coral limestone 80 ft. in vertical
thickness, resting on a friable and sparingly argillaceous rock
resembling a deep-sea deposit. A. Agassiz, in a number of
important researches on the Florida reefs, the Bahamas, the
Bermudas, the Fiji islands and the Great Barrier Reef of
Australia, has further shown that many of the peculiar features of
these coral formations cannot be explained on the theory of
subsidence, but are rather attributable to the natural growth of
corals on banks formed by prevailing currents, or on extensive
shore platforms or submarine flats formed by the erosion of
pre-existing land surfaces.</p>

<p>In face of this accumulated evidence, it must be admitted
that the subsidence theory of Darwin is inapplicable to a large
number of coral reefs and islands, but it is hardly possible to
assert, as Murray does, that no atolls or barrier reefs have ever
been developed after the manner indicated by Darwin. The
most recent research on the structure of coral reefs has also been
the most thorough and most convincing. It is obvious that,
if Murray&rsquo;s theory were correct, a bore hole sunk deep into an
atoll would pass through some 100 ft. of coral rock, then through
a greater or less thickness of argillaceous rock, and finally would
penetrate the volcanic rock on which the other materials were
deposited. If Darwin&rsquo;s theory is correct, the boring would pass
through a great thickness of coral rock, and finally, if it went
deep enough, would pass into the original rock which subsided
below the waters. An expedition sent out by the Royal Society
of London started in 1896 for the island of Funafuti, a typical
atoll of the Ellice group in the Pacific Ocean, with the purpose of
making a deep boring to test this question. The first attempt
was not successful, for at a depth of 105 ft. the refractory nature
of the rock stopped further progress. But a second attempt,
under the management of Professor Edgeworth David of Sydney,
proved a complete success. With improved apparatus, the boring
was carried down to a depth of 697 ft. (116 fathoms), and a third
attempt carried it down to 1114 ft. (185 fathoms). The boring
proves the existence of a mass of pure limestone of organic origin
to the depth of 1114 ft., and there is no trace of any other rock.
The organic remains found in the core brought up by the drill
consist of corals, foraminifera, calcareous algae and other
organisms. A boring was also made from the deck of a ship
into the floor of the lagoon, which shows that under 100 ft. of
water there exists at the bottom of the lagoon a deposit more
than 100 ft. thick, consisting of the remains of a calcareous alga,
<i>Halimeda opuntia</i>, mixed with abundant foraminifera. At greater
depths, down to 245 ft., the same materials, mixed with the remains
of branching madrepores, were met with, and further
progress was stopped by the existence of solid masses of coral,
fragments of porites, madrepora and heliopora having been
brought up in the core. These are shallow-water corals, and their
existence at a depth of nearly 46 fathoms, buried beneath a mass
of <i>Halimeda</i> and foraminifera, is clear evidence of recent subsidence.
<i>Halimeda</i> grows abundantly over the floor of the lagoon
of Funafuti, and has been observed in many other lagoons. The
writer collected a quantity of it in the lagoon of Diego Garcia
in the Chagos group. The boring demonstrates that the lagoon
of Funafuti has been filled up to an extent of at least 245 ft.
(nearly 41 fathoms), and this fact accords well with Darwin&rsquo;s
theory, but is incompatible with that of Murray. In the present
state of our knowledge it seems reasonable to conclude that coral
reefs are formed wherever the conditions suitable for growth
exist, whether in areas of subsidence, elevation or rest. A considerable
number of reefs, at all events, have not been formed
in areas of subsidence, and of these the Florida reefs, the
Bermudas, the Solomon islands, and possibly the Great Barrier
Reef of Australia are examples. Funafuti would appear to have
been formed in an area of subsidence, and it is quite probable
that the large groups of low-lying islands in the Pacific and
Indian oceans have been formed under the same conditions.
At the same time, it must be remembered that the atoll or barrier
reef shape is not necessarily evidence of formation during subsidence,
for the observations of Karl Semper, A. Agassiz, and
Guppy are sufficient to prove that these forms of reefs may be
produced by the natural growth of coral, modified by the action
of waves and currents in regions in which subsidence has certainly
not taken place.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORAM, THOMAS<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1668-1751), English philanthropist,
was born at Lyme Regis, Dorset. He began life as a seaman,
and rose to the position of merchant captain. He settled at
Taunton, Massachusetts, for several years engaging there in
farming and boat-building, and in 1703 returned to England.
His acquaintance with the destitute East End of London, and
the miserable condition of the children there, inspired him with
the idea of providing a refuge for such of them as had no legal
protector; and after seventeen years of unwearied exertion,
he obtained in 1739 a royal charter authorizing the establishment
of his hospital for foundling infants (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Foundling Hospitals</a></span>).
It was opened in Hatton Garden, on the 17th of October 1740,
with twenty inmates. For fifteen years it was supported by
voluntary contributions; but in 1756 it was endowed with a
parliamentary grant of £10,000 for the support of all that might
be sent to it. Children were brought, however, in such numbers,
and so few (not one-third, it is said) survived infancy, that the
grant was stopped, and the charity, which had been removed
to Guilford Street, was from that time only administered under
careful restrictions. Coram&rsquo;s later years were spent in watching
over the interests of the hospital; he was also one of the promoters
of the settlement of Georgia and Nova Scotia; and his

In carrying out his philanthropic schemes he spent nearly all
his private means; and an annuity of £170 was raised for him

<p><span class="bold">COR ANGLAIS,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> or <span class="sc">English Horn</span> (Ger. <i>englisches Horn</i> or
<i>alt Hoboe</i>; Ital. <i>corno inglese</i>), a wood-wind double-reed instrument
of the oboe family, of which it is the tenor. It is not a horn,
but bears the same relation to the oboe as the basset horn does
to the clarinet. The cor anglais differs slightly in construction
from the oboe; the conical bore of the wooden tube is wider and
slightly longer, and there is a larger globular bell and a bent metal
crook to which the double reed mouthpiece is attached. The
fingering and method of producing the sound are so similar in
both instruments that the player of the one can in a short time
master the other, but as the cor anglais is pitched a fifth lower,
the music must be transposed for it into a key a fifth higher than
the real sounds produced. The compass of the cor anglais extends
over two octaves and a fifth:</p>

<p>The true quality of the cor anglais is penetrating like that of
the oboe, but mellower and more melancholy.</p>

<p>The cor anglais is the alto Pommer (q.v.) or <i>haute-contre de
hautbois</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oboe</a></span>), gradually developed, improved and provided
with key-work. It is not known exactly when the change took
place, but it was probably during the 17th century, after the
Schalmey or Shawm had been transformed into the oboe. In a
17th century MS. (Add. 30,342, f. 145) in the British Museum,
written in French, giving pen and ink sketches of many instruments,
is an &ldquo;accord de hautbois&rdquo; which comprises a <i>pédalle</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
(bass oboe or Pommer), a <i>sacquebute</i> (sackbut) as <i>basse-contre</i>,
a <i>taille</i> (tenor) with a note that the <i>haute-contre</i> (the cor anglais)
<i>est de mesme sinon plus petite</i>. The tubes of all the members of
the hautbois family are straight in this drawing. Before 1688
the French hoboy, made in four parts and having two keys, was
known in England.<a name="FnAnchor_1a" id="FnAnchor_1a" href="#Footnote_1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> It is probable that in France, where the
hautbois played such an important part in court music, the cor
anglais, under the name of <i>haute-contre de hautbois</i>, was also
provided with keys. At the end of the 17th century there were
two players of the <i>haute-contre de hautbois</i> among the musicians
of the Grande Écurie du Roi.<a name="FnAnchor_2a" id="FnAnchor_2a" href="#Footnote_2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The origin of the name of the instrument is also a matter of
conjecture. Two theories exist&mdash;one that cor anglais is a corruption
of <i>cor anglé</i>, a name given on account of
the angular bend of the early specimens.
In that case the name,
but not necessarily the
instrument, probably
originated in France
early in the 18th century,
for Gluck scored for two
cors anglais in his Italian
version of <i>Alceste</i> played
in Vienna in 1767. When
a French version of this
opera was given in Paris
two years later, the cor
anglais, not being known
or available there, was
replaced by oboes. It
was not until 1808 that
the cor anglais was
heard at the Paris Opera,
when it was played by
the oboist Vogt in Catel&rsquo;s
<i>Alexandre chez Apelle</i>.
This, however, proves
only that the name was
not familiar in France,
where the oboe of the
same pitch was called
<i>haute-contre de hautbois</i>.
The bending of the tube
and the development of
the cor anglais as solo
instrument originated in
Germany, unless the
<i>oboe da caccia</i> was identical
with the cor anglais,
in which case Italy
would be the country of
origin. Thomas
Stanesby, junior, made
an oboe da caccia in
1740 of straight pattern
in four pieces, having a
bent metal crook for the
insertion of the reed and
two saddle keys; but
the bell was like the bell
of the oboe, not globular
like that of the cor
anglais, a form to which
the veiled quality of its
<i>timbre</i> is due. It is interesting
in this connexion
to recall some
experiments in bending
the cor anglais, which
do not appear to have
led to any practical result. A French broadside (c. 1650), &ldquo;La
Musique,&rdquo; preserved in the British Museum, contains drawings
of many musical instruments in use in the 17th century;
among them are an oboe with keys in a perforated case, and two
other wood wind instruments of the same family, which may be
taken to represent attempts to dispose of the inconvenient length of
the <i>haute-contre</i> (1) by bending the tube at right angles for about one
quarter of its length from the mouthpiece, which contains a large
double reed, (2) by bending the tube in the elongated &ldquo;S&rdquo; shape of
the <i>corno torto</i> or bass Zinke, for which the drawing in question
might be mistaken but for the bent crook inserted in the end for the
reception of the reed, which, however, is missing. The other hypothesis
is that when the cor anglais was given a bend in order to
facilitate the handling, the name was adopted to mark its resemblance
to a kind of hunting-horn said to be in use in England at the time.
This suggestion does not seem to be a happy one; for if the reference
be to the crescent-shaped horn, that instrument was in use in all
countries at various periods before the 17th century, while if it be
to the angular form, then a reproduction of such a horn should be
forthcoming to support the statement.</p>

<p>The idea of bending the instrument is attributed to Giovanni or
Giuseppe Ferlendis of Bergamo,<a name="FnAnchor_3a" id="FnAnchor_3a" href="#Footnote_3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> brothers and virtuosi on the oboe.
One of these had settled in Salzburg, and both were equally renowned
as performers on the English horn. They visited Venice, Brescia,
Trieste, Vienna, London (in 1795) and Lisbon, where Giuseppe died.
In this case we might expect the name to have been given in Italian,
<i>corno inglese</i>; yet Gluck in his Italian edition used the French name
already in 1767, when Giuseppe was but twelve years old. We must
await some more conclusive explanation, but we may suppose that
the new name was bestowed when the instrument assumed a form
entirely new to the family of hautbois or oboes. The cor anglais
was well known in England before 1774, for in a quaint book of travels
through England, published in that year, we read that Signor
Sougelder,<a name="FnAnchor_4a" id="FnAnchor_4a" href="#Footnote_4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a> &ldquo;an eminent surgeon of Bristol,&rdquo; was a performer &ldquo;on
the English horn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The experiment of bending the cor anglais did not prove satisfactory,
for the tube instead of being bored had to be cut out of two
pieces of wood which were then glued together and covered with
leather. Even the most skilful craftsman did not succeed in making
the inside of the tube quite smooth; the roughness of the wood was
detrimental to the tone and gave the cor anglais a veiled, somewhat
hoarse quality, and makers before long reverted to the direct or
vertical form.</p>

gift.&rdquo; Josephus uses the word of Nazirites and of the
temple treasure of Jerusalem. Such a votive offering lay under
a curse if it were diverted to ordinary purposes, like the spoil
of Jericho which Achan appropriated (Josh. vii.), or the temple
treasure of Delphi which was seized by the Phocians, 356 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
The word is found in Mark vii. 11, the usual interpretation of
which is that Jesus refers to an abuse&mdash;a man might declare
that any part of his property which came into his parents&rsquo; hands
was <i>corban</i>, consecrated, i.e. that a curse rested on any benefit
they might get from it. The Jewish scribes thus fenced the law
of vows with a traditional interpretation which made men break
the most binding injunctions of the Mosaic Law, in this case
the fifth commandment. A totally different explanation of the
passage is put forward by J. H. A. Hart in <i>The Jewish Quarterly
Review</i> for July 1907, the gist of which is that Jesus commends
the Pharisees for insisting that when a man has vowed a
vow to God he should pay it even though his parents should
suffer.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORBEIL, WILLIAM OF<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (d. 1136), archbishop of Canterbury,
was born probably at Corbeil on the Seine, and was educated
at Laon. He was soon in the service of Ranulf Flambard,
bishop of Durham; then, having entered the order of St
Augustine, he became prior of the Augustinian foundation at
St Osyth in Essex. At the beginning of 1123 he was chosen
from among several candidates to be archbishop of Canterbury,
and as he refused to admit that Thurstan, archbishop of York,
was independent of the see of Canterbury, this prelate refused
to consecrate him, and the ceremony was performed by his own
suffragan bishops. Proceeding to Rome the new archbishop
found that Thurstan had anticipated his arrival in that city and
had made out a strong case against him to Pope Calixtus II.;
however, the exertions of the English king Henry I. and of the
emperor Henry V. prevailed, and the pope gave William the
pallium. The archbishop&rsquo;s next dispute was with the papal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
legate. Cardinal John of Crema, who had arrived in England
and was acting in an autocratic manner. Again travelling to
Rome, William gained another victory, and was himself appointed
papal legate (<i>legatus natus</i>) in England and Scotland, a precedent
of considerable importance in the history of the English Church.
The archbishop had sworn to Henry I. that he would support
the claim of his daughter Matilda to the English crown, but
nevertheless he crowned Stephen in December 1135. He died
at Canterbury on the 21st of November 1136. William built
the keep of Rochester Castle, and finished the building of the
cathedral at Canterbury, which was dedicated with great pomp
in May 1130.</p>

in the department of Seine-et-Oise, at the confluence of
the Essonne with the Seine, 21 m. S. by E. of Paris on the
Orléans railway to Nevers. Pop. (1906) 9756. A bridge across
the Seine unites the main part of the town on the left bank with
a suburb on the other side; handsome boulevards lead to the
village of Essonnes (pop. 7255), about a mile to the south-west.
St Spire, the only survivor of the formerly numerous churches
of Corbeil, dates from the 12th to the 15th centuries. Behind
the church there is a Gothic gateway. A monument has been
erected to the brothers Galignani, publishers of Paris, who gave
a hospital and orphanage to the town. Corbeil is the seat of a
sub-prefect, and has tribunals of first instance and commerce
and a chamber of commerce. It has important flour-mills,
tallow-works, printing-works, large paper-works at Essonnes,
and carries on boat and carriage-building, and the manufacture
of plaster. The Decauville engineering works are in the vicinity.
There is trade in grain and flour.</p>

<p>From the 10th to the 12th century Corbeil was the chief town
of a powerful countship, but it was united to the crown by
Louis VI.; it continued for a long time to be an important
military post in connexion with the commissariat of Paris. In
1258 St Louis concluded a treaty here with James I. of Aragon.
Of the numerous sieges to which it has been exposed the most
important were those by the Huguenots in 1562, and by Alexander
Farnese, prince of Parma, in 1590.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORBEL<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (Lat. <i>corbellus</i>, a diminutive of <i>corvus</i>, a raven, on
account of the beak-like appearance; Ital. <i>mensola</i>, Fr. <i>corbeau</i>,
<i>cul-de-lampe</i>, Ger. <i>Kragstein</i>), the name in medieval architecture
for a piece of stone jutting out of a wall to carry any super-incumbent
weight. A piece of timber projecting in the same
way was called a tassel or a bragger. Thus the carved ornaments
from which the vaulting shafts spring at Lincoln are corbels.
Norman corbels are generally plain. In the Early English period
they are sometimes elaborately carved, as at Lincoln above
cited, and sometimes more simply so, as at Stone. They sometimes
end with a point apparently growing into the wall, or
forming a knot, as at Winchester, and often are supported by
angels and other figures. In the later periods the foliage or
ornaments resemble those in the capitals. The corbels carrying
the arches of the corbel tables in Italy and France were often
elaborately moulded, and sometimes in two or three courses
projecting over one another; those carrying the machicolations
of English and French castles had four courses. The corbels
carrying balconies in Italy and France were sometimes of great
size and richly carved, and some of the finest examples of the
Italian Cinquecento style are found in them. Throughout
England, in half-timber work, wood corbels abound, carrying
window-sills or oriels in wood, which also are often carved. A
&ldquo;corbel table&rdquo; is a projecting moulded string course supported
by a range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small
arcade under the string course, the arches of which are pointed
and trefoiled. As a rule the corbel table carries the gutter, but
in Lombard work the arcaded corbel table was utilized as a
decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface.
In Italy sometimes over the corbels will be a moulding, and above
a plain piece of projecting wall forming a parapet (see also

<p><span class="bold">CORBET, RICHARD<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (1582-1635), English bishop and poet,
was born in 1582, the son of a nurseryman at Ewell, Surrey. At
Oxford, to which he proceeded from Westminster school in
1597, he was noted as a wit. On taking orders he continued to
display this talent from the pulpit, and James I., in consideration
of his &ldquo;fine fancy and preaching,&rdquo; made him one of the royal
chaplains. In 1620 he became vicar of Stewkley, Berkshire,
and in the same year was made dean of Christchurch, Oxford.
In 1628 he was made bishop of Oxford, and in 1632 translated
thence to the see of Norwich. Corbet was the author of many
poems, for the most part of a lively, satirical order, his most
serious production being the <i>Fairies&rsquo; Farewell</i>. His verses
were first collected and published in 1647. His conviviality
was famous, and many stories are told of his youthful merrymaking

<p><span class="bold">CORBRIDGE,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> a small market town in the Hexham parliamentary

Hexham, on the north bank of the river Tyne, which is here crossed
by a fine seven-arched bridge dating from 1674. Pop. (1901)
1647. Corbridge was formerly of greater importance than at
present. Its name, derived from the small river Cor, a tributary
of the Tyne, is said to be associated with the Brigantian tribe
of Corionototai. About 760 it became the capital of Northumbria;
later it was a borough and was long represented in parliament.
In 1138 David of Scotland made it a centre of military
operations, and it was ravaged by Wallace in 1296, by Bruce in
1312, and by David II. in 1346. Its chief remains of antiquity are
a square peel-tower and the cruciform church of St Andrew,
of which part of the fabric is of pre-Conquest date, though the
building is mainly Early English. Extensive use is made of
building materials from the Roman station of <i>Corstopitum</i> (also
called Corchester), which lay half a mile west of Corbridge at
the junction of the Cor with the Tyne. This site has from time
to time yielded many valuable relics, notably a silver dish,
discovered in 1734, 148 oz. in weight and ornamented with
figures of deities; but the first-rate importance of the station
was only revealed by careful excavations undertaken in 1907 seq.
There were then unearthed remains of several buildings fronting
a broad thoroughfare, one of which is the largest Roman building,
except the baths at Bath, yet discovered in England. Two of
these buildings were granaries, and indicate the importance of
Corstopitum as a base of the northward operations of Antoninus
Pius. After his conquests had been lost, and Corstopitum
ceased to be a military centre, its military buildings passed into
civilian occupation, of which many evidences have been found.
A fine hoard of gold coins, wrapped in lead-foil and hidden in a
wall, was discovered in 1908. Corstopitum ceased to exist
early in the 5th century, and the site was never again occupied.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORBULO, GNAEUS DOMITIUS<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (1st century A.D.), Roman
general, was the half-brother of Caesonia, one of the wives of the
emperor Caligula. In the reign of Tiberius he held the office
of praetor, and was appointed to the superintendence of the
roads and bridges. Under Claudius he was governor of lower
Germany (A.D. 47). He punished the Frisii who refused to pay
the tribute, and was on the point of advancing against the Chauci,
but was recalled by the emperor and ordered to withdraw behind
the Rhine. In order to provide employment for his soldiers,
Corbulo made them cut a canal from the Mosa (Meuse) to the
northern branch of the Rhine, which still forms one of the chief
drains between Leiden and Sluys, and before the introduction
of railways was the ordinary traffic road between Leiden and
Rotterdam. Soon after the accession of Nero, Vologaeses (Vologasus),
king of Parthia, overran Armenia, drove out Rhadamistus,
who was under the protection of the Romans, and set his own
brother Tiridates on the throne. Corbulo was thereupon sent out
to the East with full military powers. After some delay, he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
the offensive in 58, and, reinforced by troops from Germany,
attacked Tiridates. Artaxata and Tigranocerta were captured,
and Tigranes, who had been brought up in Rome and was
the obedient servant of the government, was installed king
of Armenia. In 61 Tigranes invaded Adiabene, an integral
portion of the Parthian kingdom, and a conflict between
Rome and Parthia seemed unavoidable. Vologaeses, however,
thought it better to come to terms. It was agreed
that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate
Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and the position
of Tiridates recognized. The Roman government declined to
accede to these arrangements, and L. Caesennius Paetus, governor
of Cappadocia, was ordered to settle the question by bringing
Armenia under direct Roman administration. The protection
of Syria in the meantime claimed all Corbulo&rsquo;s attention. Paetus,
a weak and incapable man, suffered a severe defeat at Rhandea
(62), where he was surrounded and forced to capitulate and to
evacuate Armenia. The command of the troops was again
entrusted to Corbulo. In 63, with a strong army, he crossed the
Euphrates, but Tiridates declined to give battle and concluded
peace. At Rhandea he laid down his diadem at the foot of the
emperor&rsquo;s statue, promising not to resume it until he received
it from the hand of Nero himself in Rome. In 67 disturbances
broke out in Judaea, but Nero, jealous of Corbulo&rsquo;s success and
popularity, ordered Vespasian to take command of the forces and
summoned Corbulo to Greece. On his arrival at Cenchreae, the
port of Corinth, messengers from Nero met Corbulo, and ordered
him to commit suicide. Without hesitation he obeyed, exclaiming,
&ldquo;I have deserved it.&rdquo; Whether he had really given
any grounds for suspicion is unknown; but there is no doubt,
so great was his popularity with the soldiers and such the hatred
felt for Nero, that he could easily have seized the throne.
Corbulo wrote an account of his Asiatic experiences, which
is lost.</p>

Raynal. Another of her favourite authors was Plutarch, from
whose pages she doubtless imbibed the idea of classic heroism
and civic virtue which prompted the act that has made her

study current politics, chiefly in the papers issued by the party
afterwards known as the Girondins. On the downfall of this
party, on May 31, 1793, many of the leaders took refuge in Normandy,
and proposed to make Caen the headquarters of an army
of volunteers, at the head of whom Félix de Wimpffen, who commanded
the army assembled for the defence of the coasts at
Cherbourg, was to have marched upon Paris. Charlotte attended
their meetings, and heard them speak; but we have no reason to
believe that she saw any of them privately, till the day when she
went to ask for introductions to friends of theirs in Paris. She
saw that their efforts in Normandy were doomed to fail. She
had heard of Marat as a tyrant and the chief agent in their overthrow,
and she had conceived the idea of going alone to Paris
and assassinating him,&mdash;doubtless thinking that this would
break up the party of the Terrorists and be the signal of a
counter-revolution, and ignorant of the fact that Marat was ill
almost to the point of death, and that others were more influential
than he.</p>

<p>Apparently she had thought of going to Paris in April, before
the fall of the Girondins, for she had then procured a passport
which she used in July. It contained the usual description of the
bearer, and ran thus: <i>Laissez passer la citoyenne Marie, &amp;c.,
Corday, âgée de 24 ans, taille de 5 pieds 1 pouce, cheveux et sourcils
châtains, yeux gris, front élevé, nez long, bouche moyenne, menton
rond fourchu, visage ovale.</i> Arrived in Paris she first attended to
some business for a friend at Caen, and then she wrote to Marat:
&ldquo;Citizen, I have just arrived from Caen. Your love for your
native place doubtless makes you desirous of learning the events
which have occurred in that part of the republic. I shall call at
your residence in about an hour; have the goodness to receive me
and to give me a brief interview. I will put you in a condition to
render great service to France.&rdquo; On calling she was refused
admittance, and wrote again, promising to reveal important
secrets, and appealing to Marat&rsquo;s sympathy on the ground that
she herself was persecuted by the enemies of the republic. She
was again refused an audience, and it was only when she called a
third time (July 13) that Marat, hearing her voice in the antechamber,
consented to see her. He lay in a bathing tub, wrapped
in towels, for he was suffering from a horrible disease which had
almost reduced him to a state of putrefaction. Our only source of
information as to what followed is Charlotte&rsquo;s own confession.
She spoke to Marat of what was passing at Caen, and his only
comment on her narrative was that all the men she had mentioned
should be guillotined in a few days. As he spoke she drew from
her bosom a dinner-knife (which she had bought the day before
for two francs) and plunged it into his left side. It pierced the lung
and the aorta. He cried out, &ldquo;<i>À moi, ma chère amie!</i>&rdquo; and
expired. Two women rushed in, and prevented Charlotte from
escaping. A crowd collected round the house, and it was with
difficulty that she was escorted to the prison of the Abbaye.
On being brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal she gloried
in her act, and when the indictment against her was read, and the
president asked her what she had to say in reply, her answer was,
&ldquo;Nothing, except that I have succeeded.&rdquo; Her advocate,
Claude François Chauveau Lagarde, put forward in vain the plea
of insanity. She was sentenced to death, and calmly thanked her
counsel for his efforts on her behalf, adding that the only
defence worthy of her was an avowal of the act. She was then
conducted to the Conciergerie, where at her own desire her
portrait (now in the museum of Versailles) was painted by the
artist Jean Jacques Hauer. She preserved her perfect calmness
to the last. When she saw the guillotine, she placed herself in
position under the fatal blade without assistance from any one.
The knife fell, and one of the executioners held up her head by the
hair, and had the brutality to strike it with his fist. Many
believed they saw the dead face blush,&mdash;probably an effect of the
red stormy sunset. It was the 17th of July 1793. It is difficult
to analyse the character of Charlotte Corday; but there was in it
much that was noble and exalted. Her mind had been formed
by her studies on a pagan type. To C. J. M. Barbaroux and the
Girondins of Caen she wrote from her prison, anticipating
happiness &ldquo;with Brutus in the Elysian Fields&rdquo; after her death,
and with this letter she sent a simple loving farewell to her father,
revealing a tender side to her character that otherwise we would
hardly have looked for in such a woman. Lamartine called her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
<i>l&rsquo;ange de l&rsquo;assassinat</i>, and Vergniaud said, &ldquo;<i>Elle nous perd, mais

<p><span class="bold">CORDELIERS, CLUB OF THE,<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Society of the Friends of
the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</span>, a popular society of the
French Revolution. It was formed by the members of the district
of the Cordeliers, when the Constituent Assembly suppressed the
60 districts of Paris to replace them with 48 sections (21st of May
1790). It held its meetings at first in the church of the monastery
of the Cordeliers,&mdash;the name given in France to the Franciscan
Observantists,&mdash;now the Dupuytren museum of anatomy in
connexion with the school of medicine. From 1791, however, the
Cordeliers met in a hall in the rue Dauphine. The aim of the
society was to keep an eye on the government; its emblem on its
papers was simply an open eye. It sought as well to encourage
revolutionary measures against the monarchy and the old régime,
and it was it especially which popularized the motto &ldquo;Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity.&rdquo; It took an active part in the movement
against the monarchy of the 20th of June and the 10th of August
1792; but after that date the more moderate leaders of the club,
Danton, Fabre d&rsquo;Eglantine, Camille Desmoulins, seem to have
ceased attending, and the &ldquo;<i>enragés</i>&rdquo; obtained control, such as
J. R. Hébert, F. N. Vincent, C. P. H. Ronsin and A. F. Momoro.
Its influence was especially seen in the creation of the revolutionary
army destined to assure provisions for Paris, and in the
establishment of the worship of Reason. The Cordeliers were
combated by those revolutionists who wished to end the Terror,
especially by Danton, and by Camille Desmoulins in his journal
<i>Le Vieux Cordelier</i>. The club disowned Danton and Desmoulins
and attacked Robespierre for his &ldquo;moderation,&rdquo; but the new
insurrection which it attempted failed, and its leaders were
guillotined on the 24th of March 1794, from which date nothing is
known of the club. We know little of its composition.</p>

which covers the summit and slopes of an isolated hill, was a
bastide founded by Raymond VII., count of Toulouse, in the first
half of the 13th century. It preserves its medieval aspect to a
remarkable degree, a large number of houses of the 13th and 14th

<p><span class="bold">CORDILLERA,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> a Spanish term for a range or chain of
mountains, derived from the Old Spanish <i>cordilla</i>, the diminutive
of <i>cuerda</i>, a cord or rope. The name was first given to the Andes
ranges of South America, <i>Las Cordilleras de los Andes</i>, and
applied to the extension of the system into Mexico. In North
America the parallel ranges of mountains running between and
including the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada are known
as the &ldquo;Cordilleras,&rdquo; and that part of the western continent
crossed by them has been termed the &ldquo;Cordilleran region.&rdquo;
Although the name has been applied to the eastern mountain
system of Australia, the word is not, outside America, used as a
generic term for parallel ranges of mountains.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORDITE,<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> the name given to the smokeless propellant in use
in the British army and navy. The material is produced in the
form of cylindrical rods or strings of varying thicknesses by
pressing the material, whilst in a soft and pasty state, through
dies or perforations in a steel plate by hydraulic or screw pressure,
hence the name cordite. The thickness or size of the rods varies
from about 1 mm. diameter to 5 or more mm. according to the
nature of the charge for which it is intended. The smallest
diameter is used for revolver cartridge and the largest for heavy
guns. When first devised by the Ordnance Committee, presided
over by Sir Frederick Abel, in 1891, this explosive consisted of
58% of nitro-glycerin, 37% of gun-cotton, and 5% of mineral
jelly. This variety is now known as Cordite Mark 1. At the
present time a modification is made which contains gun-cotton
65%, nitro-glycerin 30%, and mineral jelly 5%. This is known
as Cordite M.D. The advantages of Cordite M.D. over Mark 1
are slightly reduced rate of burning, higher velocities and
more regular pressure in the gun, and lower temperature.</p>

<p>Cordite of either mark is a perfectly waterproof substance,
containing only traces of water remaining from the manufacturing
processes. It has a density of about 1.56 at the ordinary
temperature (15° C.), and, as its coefficient of expansion is small,
this density does not change to any serious extent under climatic
temperature variations. A rod may be bent to a moderate
extent without breaking, and Cordite M.D. especially shows
considerable elasticity. It can be impressed by the nail and cut
with a knife, but is not in the least sticky, nor does the nitro-glycerin
exude to any appreciable extent. It can be obtained
in a finely-divided state by scraping with a sharp knife, or on a
new file, or by grinding in a mill, such as a coffee-mill, but can
scarcely be pounded in a mortar. Cordite is of a brownish
colour in mass, but is much paler when finely ground or scraped.
The rods easily become electrified by gentle friction with a dry
substance. Like all colloidal substances it is an exceedingly
bad conductor of heat. A piece ignited in air burns with a
yellowish flame. With the smaller sizes, about 2 mm. diameter
or less, this flame may be blown out, and the rod will continue
to burn in a suppressed manner without actual flame, fumes
containing oxides of nitrogen being emitted. Temperature
appears to have an effect on the rate of burning. When much
cooled it certainly burns more slowly than when at the ordinary
air temperature, and is also more difficult to ignite. Rods of
moderate thickness, say from 5 mm. diameter, will continue to
burn under water if first ignited in air and the burning portion
slowly immersed. The end of a rod of cordite may be struck a
moderately heavy blow on an anvil without exploding or igniting.
The rod will first flatten out. A <i>sharp</i> blow will then detonate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
or explode the portion immediately under the hammer, the
remainder of the rod remaining quite intact. Bullets may be
fired through a bundle or package of cordite without detonating
or inflaming it. This is of course a valuable quality. The
exact temperature at which substances ignite or take fire is in
all cases difficult to determine with any exactness. Cordite is
not <i>instantly</i> ignited on contact with a flame such as that of a
candle, because, perhaps, of the condensation of some moisture
from the products of burning of the candle upon it. A blow-pipe
flame or a red-hot wire is more rapid in action. The ignition
temperature may be somewhere in the region of 180° C.</p>

<p>All the members of this class of explosive when kept for some
time at (for them) moderately high temperatures, such as the
boiling-point of water (100° C.), show signs of decomposition;
oxides of nitrogen are liberated, and some complex oxidation
processes are started. Carefully prepared gun-cotton and nitro-glycerin
will, however, withstand this temperature for a long
time without serious detriment, excepting that nitro-glycerin
is slightly volatilized. When incorporated in cordite, however,
the nitro-glycerin appears to be much less volatile than when
free at this temperature. Under reduced pressure (3 or 4 in.
only of mercury instead of 30) it is possible to distil away a
considerable amount of nitro-glycerin from cordite at 100° C.
It is very doubtful whether at ordinary temperatures and
pressures any nitro-glycerin whatever evaporates.</p>

<p>Cordite may be kept in contact with clean, dry metals, wood,
paper, and a number of ordinary substances without deterioration.
In contact with damp and easily oxidizable metals all the
substances of the gun-cotton class are liable to a slight local
action, but the colloid nature, and probably also the contained
mineral jelly, protect cordite considerably in these circumstances.
Ammonia has a deleterious action, but even this proceeds but
slowly. Cordite does not appear to change when kept under
water.</p>

<p>The manufacturing processes comprise: drying the gun-cotton
and nitro-glycerin; melting and filtering the mineral
jelly; weighing and mixing the nitro-glycerin with the gun-cotton;
moistening this mixture with acetone until it becomes a jelly;
and then incorporating in a special mixing mill for about three
hours, after which the weighed amount of mineral jelly is
added and the incorporation continued for about one hour
or until judged complete. The incorporating or mixing machine
is covered as closely as possible to prevent too great evaporation
of the very volatile acetone. Before complete incorporation
the mixture is termed, in the works, &ldquo;paste,&rdquo; and, when finally
mixed, &ldquo;dough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The right consistency having been produced, the material is
placed in a steel cylinder provided with an arrangement of dies
or holes of regulated size at one end, and a piston or plunger
at the other. The plunger is worked either by hydraulic power
or by a screw (driven from ordinary shafting). Before reaching
and passing through the holes in the die, the material is filtered
through a disk of fine wire gauze to retain any foreign substances,
such as sand, bits of wood or metal, or unchanged fibres of
cellulose, &amp;c., which might choke the dies or be otherwise
dangerous. The material issues from the cylinders in the form
of cord or string of the diameter of the holes of the die. The
thicker sizes are cut off, as they issue, into lengths (of about
3 ft.), it being generally arranged that a certain number of these&mdash;say
ten&mdash;should have, within narrow limits, a definite weight.
The small sizes, such as those employed for rifle cartridges, are
wound on reels or drums, as the material issues from the press
cylinders, in lengths of many yards.</p>

<p>Some of the solvent or gelatinizing material (acetone) is lost
during the incorporating, and more during the pressing process
and the necessary handling, but much still remains in the
cordite at this stage. It is now dried in heated rooms, where
it is generally spread out on shelves, a current of air passing
through carrying the acetone vapour with it. In the more
modern works this air current is drawn, finally, through a solution
of a substance such as sodium bisulphite; a fixed compound
is thus formed with the acetone, which by suitable treatment
may be recovered. The time taken in the drying varies with
the thickness of the cordite from a few days to several weeks.
For several reasons it is desirable that this process should go on
gradually and slowly.</p>

<p>After drying, all the various batches of cordite of the same
size are carefully &ldquo;blended,&rdquo; so that any slight differences in
the manufacture of one batch or one day&rsquo;s output may be equalized
as much as possible. Slight differences may arise from the
raw materials, cotton waste or glycerin, or in the making of these
into gun-cotton or nitro-glycerin respectively. To help in controlling
the blending, each &ldquo;make&rdquo; of gun-cotton and nitro-glycerin
is &ldquo;marked&rdquo; or numbered, and carries its mark to the
cordite batch of which it is an ingredient. The history of each
box of large-sized or reel of small-sized cordite is therefore known
up to the operation of blending and packing. The final testing
is by firing proofs, as in the case of the old gunpowders.</p>

<p>The gun-cotton employed for cordite is made in the usual way
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gun-Cotton</a></span>), with the exception of treating with alkali.
It is also after complete washing with water gently pressed into
small cylinders (about 3 in. diameter and 4 in. high) whilst wet,
and these are carefully dried before the nitro-glycerin is added.
The pressure applied is only sufficient to make the gun-cotton
just hold together so that it is easily mixed with the nitro-glycerin.
The mineral jelly or vaseline is obtained at a certain stage of
distillation of petroleum, and is a mixture of hydrocarbons,
paraffins, olefines and some other unsaturated hydrocarbons,
possibly aromatic, which no doubt play a very important part
as preservatives in cordite.</p>

<p>The stability of cordite, that is, its capability of keeping
without chemical or ballistic changes, is judged of by certain
&ldquo;heat tests.&rdquo; The Abel heat test consists in subjecting a weighed
quantity, 2 grams, of the finely divided cordite contained in a
test tube, to a temperature of 70° C. maintained constant by a
water bath. The test tube is about 6&times;¾ in., and dips into the
water sufficiently to immerse about 2 in., viz. the part containing
the cordite. In the upper free portion a piece of filter-paper
impregnated with a mixture of potassium iodide and starch
paste is suspended by a platinum wire from the stopper of the
tube. A portion of the test paper is moistened with a solution
of glycerin to render it more sensitive than the dry part. A
faint brown colour appearing on the moistened portion indicates
that some oxides of nitrogen have been evolved from the cordite.
This brown tint is compared with a standard, and the time taken
before the standard tint appears is noted. The time fixed upon
as a test of relative stability is an arbitrary one determined
by examination of well-known specimens. Should the cordite
or other explosive contain traces of mercury salts, such as
mercuric chloride, which is sometimes added as a preservative,
this test is rendered nugatory, and no coloration may appear
(or only after a long exposure), although the sample may be of
indifferent stability. It is now customary to examine specially
for mercury, either by heating the explosive in contact with
gold leaf or silver foil, or by burning the substance and
examining the flame in the spectroscope.</p>

<p>The method of examination known as the vacuum silvered
vessel process is probably not interfered with by the presence
of very small quantities of mercury. It consists in heating
50 grams of the finely divided explosive in a Dewar&rsquo;s silvered
vacuum glass bulb to a rigidly constant temperature of 80° C.
for many hours. A sensitive thermometer having its bulb
immersed in the centre of the cordite shows when the temperature
rises above 80°. Such a rise indicates internal oxidation or
decomposition of the explosive; it is accompanied by an evolution
of nitrogen dioxide, NO<span class="su">2</span>, the depth of colour of which is
noted through a side tube attached to the bulb. As all explosives
of this class would in time decompose sufficiently to give these
indications, time periods or limits have been fixed at which an
appreciable and definite rise in temperature and production of
red fumes indicate relative stability or instability.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CÓRDOBA, GONZALO FERNANDEZ DE<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> (1453-1515), Spanish
general and statesman, usually spoken of by the Italianized
form of his Christian name as <span class="sc">Gonsalvo de Córdoba</span>, or as &ldquo;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
Great Captain,&rdquo; was the second son of Don Pedro Fernandez
de Córdoba, count of Aguilar, and of his wife Elvira de Herrera,
who belonged to the family of Enriquez, the hereditary admirals
of Castile, a branch of the royal house. Gonzalo was born at
Montilla near the city of Córdova (Cordoba) on the 16th of March
1453. The father died when he and his elder brother, Don
Alonso, were mere boys. The counts of Aguilar carried on an
hereditary feud with the rival house of Cabra, and the children
were carried by their vassals into the faction fights of the two
families. As a younger son Gonzalo had his fortune to make, but
he was generously aided by the affection of his elder brother,
who was very wealthy. War and service in the king&rsquo;s court
offered the one acceptable career outside the church to a gentleman
of his birth.</p>

<p>He was first attached to the household of Don Alphonso, the
king&rsquo;s brother, and upon his death devoted himself to Isabella,
afterwards the queen. During the civil war, and the conflict
with Portugal which disturbed the first years of her reign, he
fought under the grand master of Santiago, Alonso de Cardenas.
After the battle of Albuera, the grand master gave him especial
praise, saying that he could always see Gonzalo to the front
because he was conspicuous by the splendour of his armour.
Indeed the future Great Captain, who, as a general, was above
all things astute and patient, could, and habitually did, display
the most reckless personal daring, going into a fight as if he loved
it, and having a shrewd sense that a reputation for intrepidity,
a free-handed profusion, and the personal magnificence which
strikes the eye, would secure him the devotion of his soldiers.
During the ten years&rsquo; war for the conquest of Granada he completed
his apprenticeship under his brother, the count of Aguilar,
the grand master of Santiago, and the count of Tendilla, of whom
he always spoke as his masters. It was a war of surprises and
defences of castles or towns, of skirmishes, and of ambuscades
in the defiles of the mountains. The military engineer and the
&ldquo;guerrillero&rdquo; were about equally employed. Gonzalo&rsquo;s most
distinguished single feat was the defence of the advanced post of
Illora, but he commanded the queen&rsquo;s escort when she wished
to take a closer view of Granada, and he beat back a sortie of the
Moors under her eyes. When Granada surrendered, he was one
of the officers chosen to arrange the capitulation, and on the
peace he was rewarded by a grant of land.</p>

<p>So far he was only known as an able subordinate, but his
capacity could not be hidden from such an excellent judge of
character as Isabella, to whom as a woman he appealed by a
chivalrous union of devotion and respect. When, therefore, the
Catholic sovereigns decided to support the Aragonese house of
Naples against Charles VIII. of France, Gonzalo was chosen
by the influence of the queen, and in preference to older men,
to command the Spanish expedition. It was in Italy that he won
the title of the Great Captain; Guicciardini says that it was
given him by the customary arrogance of the Spaniards, but it
was certainly accepted as just by all the soldiers of the time of
whatever nationality. A detailed account of his campaigns
cannot be given here. He held the command in Italy twice. In
1495 he was sent with a small force of little more than five
thousand men to aid Ferdinand of Naples to recover his kingdom,
and he returned home after achieving success, in 1498. After a
brief interval of service against the conquered Moors who had
risen in revolt, he returned to Italy in 1501. Ferdinand of Spain
had entered into his iniquitous compact with Louis XII. of France
for the spoliation and division of the kingdom of Naples. The
Great Captain was chosen to command the Spanish part of this
robber coalition. As general and as viceroy of Naples he remained
in Italy till 1507. During his first command he was
mostly employed in Calabria in mountain warfare which bore
much resemblance to his former experience in Granada. There
was, however, a material difference in the enemy. The French
forces, commanded by the Scotsman Stuart d&rsquo;Aubigny, consisted
largely of Swiss pikemen, and of their own men-at-arms.
With his veterans of the Granadine war, foot soldiers armed with
sword and buckler, or arquebuses and crossbows, and light
cavalry, trained to unsleeping vigilance, capable of long marches,
and of an endurance unparalleled among the soldiers of the time,
he could carry on a guerrillero warfare which wore down his
opponents, who suffered far more than the Spaniards from the
heat. But he saw clearly that this was not enough. His experience
in Seminara showed him that something more was
wanted on the battlefield. The action was lost mainly because
King Ferdinand, disregarding the advice of Gonzalo, persisted
in fighting a pitched battle with inferior numbers, some of whom
were untrustworthy Neapolitans. The Spanish foot behaved
excellently, but the result showed that in the open field their loose
formation and their swords put them at a disadvantage as against
a charge of heavy cavalry or pikemen. Gonzalo therefore
introduced a much more strict formation, and adopted the pike
as the weapon of a part of his foot. The division of the Spanish
infantry into the &ldquo;battle&rdquo; or main central body of pikemen,
and the wings (<i>alas</i>) of &ldquo;shot&rdquo; to be employed in outflanking the
enemy, was primarily due to the Great Captain.</p>

<p>The French were expelled by 1498 without another battle.
When the Great Captain reappeared in Italy he had first to
perform the congenial task of driving the Turk from Cephalonia,
then to aid in robbing the king of Naples, Frederick, brother of
his old ally Ferdinand. When the king of Naples had been
despoiled, the French and Spaniards quarrelled over the booty.
The Great Captain now found himself with a much outnumbered
army in the presence of the French. The war was divided into
two phases very similar to one another. During the end of 1502
and the early part of 1503 the Spaniards stood at bay in the
entrenched camp at Barletta near the Ofanto on the shores of
the Adriatic. He resolutely refused to be tempted into battle
either by the taunts of the French or the discontent of his own
soldiers. Meanwhile he employed the Aragonese partisans in
the country, and flying expeditions of his own men, to harass
the enemy&rsquo;s communications. When he was reinforced, and
the French committed the mistake of scattering their forces too
much to secure supplies, he took the offensive, pounced on the
enemy&rsquo;s depot of provisions at Cerignola, took a strong position,
threw up hasty field works, and strengthened them with a species
of wire entanglements. The French made a headlong front
attack, were repulsed, assailed in flank, and routed. The later
operations on the Garigliano were very similar, and led to the
total expulsion of the French from Naples. Gonzalo remained
as governor of Naples till 1507. But he had become too great
not to arouse the jealousy of such a typical king of the Renaissance
as Ferdinand the Catholic. The death of the queen in 1504
had deprived him of a friend, and it must be allowed that he was
profuse in rewarding his captains and his soldiers out of the
public treasury. Ferdinand loaded him with titles and fine
words, but recalled him so soon as he could, and left him unemployed
till his death on the 2nd of December 1515.</p>

<p>The Great Captain is sometimes spoken of as the first of modern
generals. The expression is uncritical, for modern generalship
arose from many sides, but he was emphatically a general.
There is much in his methods which bears a curious likeness
to those of the duke of Wellington; Barletta, for instance, has a
distinct resemblance to the Torres Vedras campaign, and the
battle on the Garigliano to Assaye. As an organizer he founded
the Spanish infantry of the 16th and 17th centuries, and he gave
the best proof of his influence by forming a school of officers.
The best generals of Charles V. were either the pupils of the
Great Captain or were trained by them.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CÓRDOBA,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> a large central province of the Argentine Republic,
bounded N. by Santiago del Estero, E. by Santa Fé, S. by Buenos
Aires and La Pampa, W. by San Luis and Rioja, and N.W. by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
Catamarca. Pop. (1895) 351,223; (1904, estimate) 465,464;
area, 62,160 sq. m. The greater part of the province belongs to
the pampas, though less fertile and grassy than the plains
farther E. and S. It likewise includes large saline and swampy
areas. The N.W. part of the province is traversed by an isolated
mountain system made up of the Córdoba, Pocho and Ischilin
sierras, which extend for a distance of some 200 m. in a N. and
S. direction. These ranges intercept the moist winds from the
Atlantic, and receive on their eastern slopes an abundant rainfall,
which gives them a strikingly verdant appearance in comparison
with the surrounding plains. West and N.W. of the sierras
are extensive saline basins called Las Salinas Grandes, which
extend into the neighbouring provinces and are absolutely
barren. In the N.E. the land is low and swampy; here are
the large saline lagoons of Mar Chiquita and Los Porongos.
The principal rivers, which have their sources in the sierras and
flow eastward, are the Primero and Segundo, which flow north-easterly
into the lacustrine basin of Mar Chiquita; the Tercero
and Quarto, which unite near the Santa Fé frontier to form the
Carcaraña, a tributary of the Paraná; and the Quinto, which
flows south-easterly into the swamps of the Laguna Amarga in
the S. part of the province. Countless small streams also descend
the eastern slopes of the sierras and are lost in the great plains.
The eastern districts are moderately fertile, and are chiefly
devoted to cattle-breeding, though cereals are also produced.
In the valleys and well-watered foothills of the sierras, however,
cereals, alfalfa and fruit are the principal products. The rainfall
is limited throughout the province, and irrigation is employed
in but few localities. The mineral resources include gold, silver,
copper, lead and iron, but mining is carried on only to a very
limited extent. Salt and marble are also produced. Córdoba
is traversed by several railway lines&mdash;those running westward
from Buenos Aires and Rosario to Mendoza and the Chilean
frontier, those connecting the city of Córdoba with the same
cities, and with Tucuman on the N. and Catamarca and Rioja
on the N.W. The chief towns are Córdoba, the capital, Rio
Quarto, Villa Maria, an important railway centre 82 m. S.E.
of Córdoba, and Cruz del Eje on the W. slopes of the sierras,
110 m. N.W. of Córdoba.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CÓRDOBA,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> a city in the central part of the Argentine Republic,
capital of the above province, on the Rio Primero, 435 m.
by rail N.W. of Buenos Aires by way of Rosario, 246 m. from
the latter. Pop. (1895) 42,783&mdash;the suburbs having 11,679
more&mdash;(1905, estimate) 60,000. The city is connected by
railway with Buenos Aires and Rosario, and with the capitals
of all the surrounding provinces. Córdoba stands on a high
eastward-sloping plain called the &ldquo;Altos,&rdquo; 1240 ft. above sea-level,
and is built in a broad river bottom washed out by
periodical inundations and the action of the rains on the alluvial
banks. The inundations have been brought under control by
the construction of barriers and dams, but the banks are constantly
broken down. The city is regularly laid out, and contains
many fine edifices and dwellings. Several suburban settlements
surround the city, the more important of which are served by
the urban tramway lines. The streets are lighted by gas and
electricity, and an excellent telephone service is maintained.
The noteworthy public buildings include the cathedral, a handsome
edifice curiously oriental in appearance, a massive old
Jesuit church with a ceiling of richly carved and gilded cedar, the
old university, founded in 1613, which still occupies the halls
built by the Jesuits around a large quadrangle, the fine old
<i>cabildo</i>, or government house, of Moorish appearance, and the
national observatory on the <i>barranca</i> overlooking the city.
There are, also, two national normal schools, a national college,
an episcopal seminary, an endowed Carmelite orphanage, a
national meteorological station, a national academy of sciences,
and a good public library. Among the attractive features of
the city is an alameda of about six acres, within which is a square
artificial lake of 4 acres, surrounded by shrubbery and shaded
walks; the alameda dates from the time when the Jesuits ruled
the city, and to them also are due the tiled baths, supplied with
running water. A short avenue connects the alameda with the
principal <i>plaza</i>, a pretty garden and promenade. The water
supply of Córdoba is derived from the Rio Primero, 12 m. above
the city, where an immense dam (Dique San Roque), one of the
largest of its kind in South America, has been built across the
river valley. This dam also serves to irrigate the valley below,
and to furnish power for the electric plant which provides
Córdoba with light and electric power. In and about the city
there are several industrial establishments which have sprung
into existence since the opening of the first railway in 1870. The
surrounding country is irrigated and well cultivated, and produces
an abundance of fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>The city was founded in 1573 by Luis Geronimo de Cabrera
and was for a long time distinguished for its learning and piety.
It was the headquarters of the Jesuits in this part of South
America for two centuries, and for a time the capital of the
Spanish <i>intendencia</i> of Tucuman. The expulsion of the Jesuits
in 1767 proved to be a serious blow to the academic reputation
of the city, from which it did not recover until 1870, when
President Sarmiento engaged some eminent scientific men from
Europe to teach modern science in the university.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CÓRDOBA,<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> a town of the state of Vera Cruz, Mexico, 55 m.
W.S.W. of the port of Vera Cruz, in a highly fertile valley, near
the volcano of Orizaba, and 2880 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1895)
7974. The surrounding district produces sugar, tobacco and
coffee, Córdoba being one of the principal coffee-producing
centres of Mexico. It also manufactures cotton and woollen
fabrics. The town is regularly laid out and built of stone, and
contains several handsome edifices, chief of which is the old
cathedral. Córdoba was a town of considerable importance in
colonial times, but fell into decay after the revolution. The railway
from Vera Cruz to Mexico, which passes through it, and the
development of coffee production, have helped the city to recover
a part of its lost trade.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORDON<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (a French derivative of <i>corde</i>, cord), a word used in many
applications of its meaning of &ldquo;line&rdquo; or &ldquo;cord,&rdquo; and particularly
of a cord of gold or silver lace worn in military and other uniforms.
The word is especially used of the sash or ribbon worn by members
of an order of knighthood, crossing from one shoulder to the
opposite hip. The <i>cordon bleu</i>, the sky-blue ribbon of the knight&rsquo;s
grand cross of the order of the Holy Spirit, the highest order of the
Bourbon kings of France, was, like the &ldquo;blue ribbon&rdquo; of the
English Garter, taken as a type of the highest reward or prize
to which any one can attain (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cookery</a></span>). In heraldry,
&ldquo;cordons&rdquo; are the ornamental cords which, with the hats to
which they are attached, ensign the shields of arms of certain
ecclesiastical dignitaries; they are interlaced to form a mesh
or network and terminate in rows of tassels. A cardinal&rsquo;s cordon
is <i>gules</i> with five rows of fifteen tassels, an archbishop&rsquo;s <i>vert</i> with
four rows of ten, and a bishop&rsquo;s also <i>vert</i>, with three rows of six.
In architecture a &ldquo;cordon&rdquo; is a projecting band of stone along
the outside of a building, a string-course. The word is frequently
used in a transferred sense of a line of posts or stations to guard
an enclosed area from unauthorized passage, e.g. a military or
police cordon, and especially a sanitary cordon, a line of posts to
prevent communication from or with an area infected with
disease.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORDOVA<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (Span. <i>Córdoba</i>), an inland province of southern
Spain, bounded on the N.E. by Ciudad Real, E. by Jaén, S.E.
by Granada, S. by Málaga, S.W. and W. by Seville, and N.W.
by Badajoz. Pop. (1900) 455,859; area, 5299 sq. m. The river
Guadalquivir divides the province into two very dissimilar
portions. On the right bank is the mountainous region of the
Sierra Morena, less peopled and fertile than the left bank, with
its great plains (<i>La Campiña</i>) and slightly undulating country
towards the south and south-east, where the surface again
becomes mountainous with the outlying ridges of the Sierra
Nevada. The Guadalquivir, flowing from E.N.E. to W.S.W.,
waters the richest districts of Cordova, and has many tributaries,
notably the Bembezar, Guadiato and Guadamellato, on the right,
and the Genil and Guadajoz on the left. The northern districts
(<i>Los Pedroches</i>) are drained by several small tributaries of the
Guadiana. The climate is much varied. Snow is to be found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
for months on the highest peaks of the mountains; mild temperature
in the plains, except in the few torrid summer months, when
rain seldom falls. The peasantry are chiefly occupied in various
branches of husbandry; sheep-farming and the culture of the
olive employ large numbers. The agricultural wealth of Cordova
is, however, not fully exploited, owing to the conservatism and
backward education of the peasantry. There are no great manufacturing
towns, but mining is an industry of some importance.
In 1903 coal was obtained in considerable quantities in the
Belmez district; argentiferous lead and zinc near Pozoblanco
and elsewhere; iron ore at Luque, near Baena. A small amount
of bismuth is also obtained. Mining is facilitated by a fairly
complete and well-kept system of communication by road and
railway. The main line Madrid-Lináres-Seville follows the
Guadalquivir valley throughout the province, passing through the
capital, Cordova. Here it meets the line from Almorchón, on
the north, to Málaga, on the south, which has three important
branches&mdash;Belmez-Fuente del Arco, Cordova-Utrera, and
Puente Genil-Jaén. After the capital, the principal towns are
Aguilar de la Frontera (13,236), Baena (14,539), Cabra (13,127),
Fuente Ovejuna (11,777), Lucena (21,179), Montilla (13,603),
Montoro (14,581), Pozoblanco (12,792), Priego de Cordoba
(16,904) and Puente Genil (12,956). These are described under
separate headings. Other towns of less importance are Adamuz
(6974), Belalcázar (7682), Belmez (8978), Bujalance (10,756),
Castro del Río (11,821), Hinojosa del Duque (10,673), Palma
del Río (7914), Rute (10,740) and Villafranca de Córdoba (9771).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORDOVA<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (Span. <i>Córdoba</i>; Lat. <i>Corduba</i>), the capital of the
Spanish province of Cordova, on the southern slopes of the Sierra
de Cordova, and the right bank of the river Guadalquivir. Pop.
(1900) 58,275. At Cordova the Madrid-Seville railway meets the
branch line from Almorchón to Málaga. The city is an episcopal
see. Few fragments remain of its Moorish walls, which were
erected on Roman foundations and enclosed a very wide area,
now largely occupied by garden-ground cleared from the ruins
of ancient buildings. On the outskirts are many modern factories
in striking contrast with the surrounding orange, lemon and olive
plantations, and with the pastures which belong to the celebrated
Cordovan school of bull-fighting. Nearer the centre the streets
are for the most part narrow and crooked. Almost every
building, however, is profusely covered with whitewash, and thus
there is little difference on the surface between the oldest and the
most modern houses. The southern suburb communicates with
the town by means of a bridge of sixteen arches across the river,
exhibiting the usual combination of Roman and Moorish masonry
and dominated at the one end by an elevated statue of the patron
saint, St Raphael, whose effigy is to be seen in various other
quarters of the city. The most important of the public buildings
are the cathedral, the old monastic establishments, the churches,
the bishop&rsquo;s palace, the city hall, the hospitals and the schools and
colleges, including the academy for girls founded in 1590 by
Bishop Pacheco of Cordova, which is empowered to grant degrees.
The Alcázar, or royal palace, stands on the south-west amid the
gardens laid out by its builder, the caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III.
(912-961). Its older parts are in ruins, and even the so-called
New Alcázar, erected by Alphonso XI. of Castile in 1328, and
long used as the offices of the Holy Inquisition, has only one wing
in good repair, which serves as a prison.</p>

<p>But the glory of Cordova, surpassing all its other Moorish or
Christian buildings, is the <i>mezquita</i>, or mosque, now a cathedral,
but originally founded on the site of a Roman temple and a
Visigothic church by Abd-ar-Rahman I. (756-788), who wished
to confirm the power of his caliphate by making its capital a
great religious centre. Immigration from all the lands of Islam
soon rendered a larger mosque necessary, owing to the greatly
increased multitude of worshippers, and, by orders of Abd-ar-Rahman
II. (822-852) and Al-Hakim II. (961-976), the original
size was doubled. After various minor additions, Al-Mansur,
the vizier of the caliph Hisham II. (976-1009), again enlarged
the <i>Zeca</i>, or House of Purification, as the mosque was named,
to twice its former size, rendering it the largest sacred building
of Islam, after the Kaaba at Mecca. The ground plan of the
completed mosque forms a rectangle, measuring 570 ft. in length
and 425 in breadth, or little less than St Peter&rsquo;s in Rome.
About one-third of this area is occupied by the courtyard, and
the cloisters which surround it on the north, west and east.
The exterior, with the straight lines of its square buttress towers,
has a heavy and somewhat ungainly appearance; but the
interior is one of the most beautiful specimens of Moorish
architecture. Passing through a grand courtyard about 500 ft.
in length, shady with palm and cypress and orange trees and
watered by five fountains, the visitor enters on the south a
magnificent and bewildering labyrinth of pillars in which porphyry,
jasper and many-coloured marbles are boldly combined.
Part came from the spoils of Nîmes or Narbonne, part from
Seville or Tarragona, some from the older ruins of Carthage,
and others as a present to Abd-ar-Rahman I. from the East
Roman emperor Leo IV., who sent also from Constantinople
his own skilled workmen, with 16 tons of tesserae for the mosaics.
Originally of different heights, the pillars have been adjusted
to their present standard of 12 ft. either by being sunk into
the soil or by the addition of Corinthian capitals. Twelve
hundred was the number of the columns in the original building,
but many have been destroyed. The pillars divide the area
of the building from north to south, longitudinally into nineteen
and transversely into twenty-nine aisles&mdash;each row supporting a
tier of open Moorish arches of the same height (12 ft.) with a
third and similar tier superimposed upon the second. The full
height of the ceiling is thus about 35 ft. The Moorish character
of the building was unfortunately impaired in the 16th century
by the formation in the interior of a <i>crucero</i>, or high altar and
cruciform choir, by the addition of numerous chapels along the
sides of the vast quadrangle, and by the erection of a belfry
300 ft. high in room of the old minaret. The <i>crucero</i> in itself
is no disgrace to the architect Hernan Ruiz, but every lover of
art must sympathize with the rebuke administered by the
emperor Charles V. (1500-1558) to the cathedral authorities:
&ldquo;You have built here what could have been built as well anywhere
else; and you have destroyed what was unique in the
world.&rdquo; Magnificent, indeed, as the cathedral still is, it is
almost impossible to realize what the mosque must have been
when the worshippers thronged through its nineteen gateways
of bronze, and its 4700 lamps, fed with perfumed oil, illuminated
its brilliant aisles. Of the exquisite elaboration bestowed on
the more sacred portions abundant proof is afforded by the
third <i>Mihrab</i>, or prayer-recess, a small 10th-century chapel,
heptagonal in shape, roofed with a single shell-like block of
snow-white marble, and inlaid with Byzantine mosaics of glass
and gold.</p>

<p>Cordova was celebrated in the time of the Moors for its silversmiths,
who are said to have come originally from Damascus;
and it exported a peculiar kind of leather which took its name
from the city, whence is derived the word <i>cordwainer</i>. Fine
silver filigree ornaments are still produced; and Moorish work
in leather is often skilfully imitated, although this handicraft
almost disappeared in the 15th century. The chief modern
industries of Cordova are distillation of spirits and the manufacture
of woollen, linen and silken goods.</p>

<p>Corduba, probably of Carthaginian origin, was occupied by
the Romans under Marcus Marcellus in 152 B.C.. and shortly
afterwards became the first Roman <i>colonia</i> in Spain. From the
large number of men of noble rank among the colonists, the city
obtained the title of <i>Patricia</i>; and to this day the Cordovese
pride themselves on the purity and antiquity of their descent.
In the 1st century B.C. Cordova aided the sons of Pompey against
Caesar; but after the battle of Munda, in 45 B.C., it fell into the
hands of Caesar, who avenged the obstinacy of its resistance
by massacring 20,000 of the inhabitants. Under Augustus,
if not before, it became a municipality, and was the capital of
the thoroughly Romanized province of Baetica. In the lifetime
of Strabo, however (c. 63 B.C.-A.D. 21), it still ranked as the
largest city of Spain. Its prosperity was due partly to its
position on the Baetis, and on the Via Augusta, the great commercial
road from northern Spain built by Augustus, and partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
to its proximity to mines and rich grazing and grain-producing
districts. Hosius, its bishop, presided over the first council of
Nicaea in 345; and its importance was maintained by the
Visigothic kings, whose rule lasted from the 5th to the beginning
of the 8th century. Under the Moors, Cordova was at first an
appanage of the caliphate of Damascus; but after 756 Abd-ar-Rahman
I. made it the capital of Moorish Spain, and the centre
of an independent caliphate (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abd-ar-Rahman</a></span>). It reached
its zenith of prosperity in the middle of the 10th century, under
Abd-ar-Rahman III. At his death, it is recorded by native
chroniclers, probably with Arabic exaggeration, that Cordova
contained within its walls 200,000 houses, 600 mosques, 900
baths, a university, and numerous public libraries; whilst on
the bank of the Guadalquivir, under the power of its monarch,
there were eight cities, 300 towns and 12,000 populous villages.
A period of decadence began in 1016, owing to the claims of
the rival dynasties which aimed at succeeding to the line of
Abd-ar-Rahman; the caliphate never won back its position, and
in 1236 Cordova was easily captured by Ferdinand III. of Castile.
The substitution of Spanish for Moorish supremacy rather
accelerated than arrested the decline of art, industry and population;
and in the 19th century Cordova never recovered from the
disaster of 1808, when it was stormed and sacked by the French.
Few cities of Spain, however, can boast of so long a list of
illustrious natives in the Moorish and Roman periods, and even,
to a less extent, in modern times. It was the birthplace of the
rhetorician Marcus Annaeus Seneca, and his more famous son
Lucius (c. 3 B.C.-A.D. 65); of the poet Lucan (A.D. 39-65); of
the philosophers Averroes (1126-1198) and Maimonides (1135-1204);
of the Spanish men of letters Juan de Mena (c. 1411-1456),
Lorenzo de Sepúlveda (d. 1574) and Luis de Gongora
y Argote (1561-1627); and the painters Pablo de Céspedes
(1538-1608) and Juan de Valdés Leal (1630-1691). The celebrated
captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Córdoba (q.v.), the conqueror
of Naples (1495-1498), was born in the neighbouring
town of Montilla.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORDUS, AULUS CREMUTIUS,<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> Roman historian of the later
Augustan age. He was the author of a history (perhaps called
<i>Annales</i>) of the events of the civil wars and the reign of Augustus,
embracing the period from at least 43-18 B.C. In A.D. 25 he was
brought to trial for having eulogized Brutus and spoken of
Cassius as the last of the Romans. His real offence was a witticism
at the expense of Sejanus, who put up two of his creatures
to accuse him in the senate. Seeing that nothing could save him,
Cordus starved himself to death. A decree of the senate ordered
that his works should be confiscated and burned by the aediles.
Some copies, however, were saved by the efforts of Cordus&rsquo;s
daughter Marcia, and after the death of Tiberius the work was
published at the express wish of Caligula. It is impossible to form
an opinion of it from the scanty fragments (H. Peter, <i>Historicorum
Romanorum Fragmenta</i>, 1883). According to ancient authorities,
the writer was very outspoken in his denunciations, and his
relatives considered it necessary to strike out the most offensive
passages of the work before it was widely circulated (Quintilian,

the history&mdash;perhaps a treatise on <i>Admiranda</i> or remarkable
things.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORELLI, ARCANGELO<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> (1653-1713), Italian violin-player
and composer, was born on the 12th or 13th of February 1653,
at Fusignano near Imola, and died in 1713. Of his life little
is known. His master on the violin was Bassani. Matteo
Simonelli, the well-known singer of the pope&rsquo;s chapel, taught
him composition. His first decided success was gained in Paris
at the age of nineteen. To this he owed his European reputation.
From Paris Corelli went to Germany. In 1681 he was in the
service of the electoral prince of Bavaria; between 1680 and 1685
he spent a considerable time in the house of his friend Farinelli.
In 1685 he was certainly in Rome, where he led the festival
performances of music for Queen Christine of Sweden and was
also a favourite of Cardinal Ottoboni. From 1689 to 1690 he
was in Modena, the duke of which city made him handsome
presents. In 1708 he went once more to Rome, living in the
palace of Cardinal Ottoboni. His visit to Naples, at the invitation
of the king, took place in the same year. The style of execution
introduced by Corelli and preserved by his pupils, such as
Geminiani, Locatelli, and many others, has been of vital importance
for the development of violin-playing, but he employed
only a limited portion of his instrument&rsquo;s compass, as may be
seen by his writings, wherein the parts for the violin never
proceed above D on the first string, the highest note in the third
position; it is even said that he refused to play, as impossible,
a passage which extended to A in altissimo in the overture to
Handel&rsquo;s <i>Trionfo del Tempo</i>, and took serious offence when the
composer played the note in evidence of its practicability. His
compositions for the instrument mark an epoch in the history
of chamber music; for his influence was not confined to his
own country. Even Sebastian Bach submitted to it. Musical
society in Rome owed much to Corelli. He was received in the
highest circles of the aristocracy, and arranged and for a long
time presided at the celebrated Monday concerts in the palace
of Cardinal Ottoboni. Corelli died possessed of a sum of 120,000
marks and a valuable collection of pictures, the only luxury
in which he had indulged. He left both to his benefactor and
friend, who, however, generously made over the money to Corelli&rsquo;s
relations. Corelli&rsquo;s compositions are distinguished by a beautiful
flow of melody and by a masterly treatment of the accompanying
parts, which he is justly said to have liberated from the strict
rules of counterpoint. Six collections of concerti, sonatas and
minor pieces for violin, with accompaniment of other instruments,
besides several concerted pieces for strings, are authentically
ascribed to this composer. The most important of these is the
XII. <i>Suonati a violino e violone o cimbalo</i> (Rome, 1700).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORELLI, MARIE<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (1864-&emsp;&emsp;), English novelist, was the
daughter of an Italian father and a Scottish mother, but in infancy
was adopted by Charles Mackay (q.v.), the song-writer and
journalist, whose son Eric, at his death, became her guardian.
She was sent to be educated in a French convent with the object
of training her for the musical profession, and while still a girl
composed various pieces of music. But her journalistic connexion
proved a stronger stimulus to expression, and editors
who were friends of her adopted father printed some of her
early poetry. Then she produced what was at least a clever, if
not a remarkably well written, romantic story, on the theme of
a self-revelation connecting the Christian Deity with a world
force in the form of electricity, which was published in 1886
under the title of <i>A Romance of Two Worlds</i>. It had an immediate
and large sale, which resulted, naturally, in her devoting
her inventive faculty to satisfy the public demand for similar
work. Thus she wrote in succession a series of melodramatic
romantic novels, original in some aspects of their treatment,
daring in others, but all combining a readable plot with enough
<i>au fond</i> of what the majority demanded in ethical and religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
correctness to suit a widespread contemporary taste; these were
<i>Vendetta</i> (1886), <i>Thelma</i> (1887), <i>Ardath</i> (1889), <i>The Soul of Lilith</i>
(1892), <i>Barabbas</i> (1893), <i>The Sorrows of Satan</i> (1895),&mdash;the very
titles were catching,&mdash;<i>The Mighty Atom</i> (1896),&mdash;which appealed
to all who knew enough of modern science to wish to think it
wicked,&mdash;and others, down to <i>The Master Christian</i> (1900), again
satisfying the socio-ethico-religious demand, and <i>Temporal
Power</i> (1902), with its contemporary suggestion from the accession
of Edward VII. Miss Corelli had the advantage of writing
quite sincerely and with conviction, amid what superior critics
sneered at as bad style and sensationalism, on themes which
conventional readers nevertheless enjoyed, and round plots which
were dramatic and vigorous. Her popular success was great and
advertised itself. It was helped by a well-spread belief that
Queen Victoria preferred her novels to any other. Reviewers
wrote sarcastically, and justly, of her obvious literary lapses and
failings; she retorted by pitying the poor reviewers and letting
it be understood that no books of hers were sent to the Press for
criticism. When she went to live at Stratford-on-Avon, her
personality, and her importance in the literary world, became
further allied with the historic associations of the place; and
in the public life of women writers her utterances had the <i>réclame</i>
which is emphasized by journalistic publicity. Such success is
not to be gauged by purely literary standards; the popularity of
Miss Corelli&rsquo;s novels is a phenomenon not so much of literature as
of literary energy&mdash;entirely creditable to the journalistic resource
of the writer, and characteristic of contemporary pleasure in
readable fiction.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORENZIO, BELISARIO<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (c. 1558-1643), Italian painter, a
Greek by birth, studied at Venice under Tintoretto, and then
settled at Naples, where he became famous for unscrupulous
conduct as a man and rapid execution as an artist. Though
careless in composition and a mannerist in style, he possessed
an acknowledged fertility of invention and readiness of hand;
and these qualities, allied to a certain breadth of conception,
seem in the eyes of his contemporaries to have atoned for many
defects. When Guido Reni came in 1621 to Naples to paint in
the chapel of St Januarius, Corenzio suborned an assassin to take
his life. The hired bravo killed Guido&rsquo;s assistant, and effectually
frightened Reni, who prudently withdrew to Rome. Corenzio,
however, only suffered temporary imprisonment, and lived long
enough to supplant Ribera in the good graces of Don Pedro di
Toledo, viceroy of Naples, who made him his court painter.
Corenzio vainly endeavoured to fill Guido&rsquo;s place in the chapel
of St Januarius. His work was adjudged to have been under
the mark, and yet the numerous frescoes which he left in Neapolitan
churches and palaces, and the large wall paintings which
still cover the cupola of the church of Monte Casino are evidence
of uncommon facility, and show that Corenzio was not greatly
inferior to the <i>fa prestos</i> of his time. His florid style, indeed,
seems well in keeping with the overladen architecture and full-blown
decorative ornament peculiar to the Jesuit builders of
the 17th century. Corenzio died, it is said, at the age of eighty-five
by a fall from a scaffolding.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORFE CASTLE,<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> a town in the eastern parliamentary division
of Dorsetshire, England, in the district called the Isle of Purbeck,
129½ m. S.W. by W. from London by the London &amp; South-Western
railway. Pop. (1901) 1440. The castle, through which
the town is famous, guarded a gap in the line of considerable
hills which rise in the centre of Purbeck. It is strongly placed
on an eminence falling almost sheer on three sides. Its ruins are
extensive, and date for the most part from the Norman period
to the reign of Edward I. There is, however, a trace of early
masonry which may have belonged to the Saxon house where,
in 978, King Edward the Martyr was murdered. Corfe Castle
was held for the empress Maud against King Stephen in 1139,
was frequently the residence of King John, and was a stronghold
of the barons against Henry III. Edward II. was imprisoned
here for a short period. The castle withstood a protracted
siege by the Parliamentarians in 1643, and fell to them by
treachery in 1646, after which it was dismantled and wrecked.
The church in the town, almost wholly rebuilt, is dedicated to
St Edward the Martyr. The quarrying of Purbeck stone and
the raising of potters&rsquo; clay are the chief industries.</p>

<p>Probably Corfe Castle (<i>Corfes geat</i>, <i>Corf geat</i>, <i>Corve</i>, <i>Corph</i>) was
an early Anglo-Saxon settlement. According to William of
Malmesbury the church was founded by St Aldhelm in the 7th
century. In 1086 the abbey of Shaftesbury held the manor,
which afterwards passed to the Norman kings, who raised the
castle. Its date is disputed, but the town dependent on it seems
to have grown up during the 13th century, being first mentioned
in 1290, when an inquisition states that the mayor has pesage
of wool and cheese. The rights of the burgesses seem to have
been undefined, for frequent commissions attest to encroachments
on the rights of warren, forest and wreckage belonging
to the royal manor. In 1380-1381 at an inquisition into the
liberties of Corfe Castle, the jurors declared that from time
immemorial the constable and his steward had held all pleas and
amerciaments except those of the mayor&rsquo;s court of Pie Powder,
but that the town had judgment by fire, water and combat.
The tenants, or &ldquo;barons,&rdquo; elected themselves a mayor and
coroners, but the constable received the assize of ale. Elizabeth
in 1577 gave exclusive admiralty jurisdiction within the island
of Purbeck to Sir Christopher Hatton, and granted the mayor
and &ldquo;barons&rdquo; of Corfe the rights they enjoyed by prescription
and charter and that of not being placed on juries or assizes in
matters beyond the island. Charles II. incorporated Corfe
Castle in 1663, the mayor being elected at a court leet from three
nominees of the lord of the manor. Corfe Castle first returned
two representatives to parliament in 1572, but was disfranchised
in 1832. A market for each Saturday was granted to Corfe in
1214, and in 1248 the town obtained a fair and a market on each
Thursday, while Elizabeth granted fairs on the feasts of St
Philip and St James and of St Luke; both of these still survive.
As early as the 14th century the quarrying and export of marble
gave employment to the men of Corfe, and during the 18th
century the knitting of stockings was a flourishing industry.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORFINIUM,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> in ancient Italy, the chief city of the Paeligni,
7 m. N. of Sulmona in the valley of the Aternus. The site of
the original town is occupied by the village of Pentima. It
probably became subject to Rome in the 4th century B.C.,
though it does not appear in Roman history before the Social
War (90 B.C.), in which it was at first adopted by the allies as
the capital and seat of government of their newly founded state
under the name Italia (this form, not Italica, is vouched for by
the coins). It appears also as a fortress of importance in the
Civil War, though it only resisted Caesar&rsquo;s attack for a week
(49 B.C.). Whether the Via Valeria ran as far as Corfinium
before the time of Claudius is uncertain: he, however, certainly
extended it to the Adriatic, and at the same time constructed
a cross road, the Via Claudia Nova, which diverged from the
Via Claudia Valeria at a point 6 m. farther north, and led past
Peltuinum and Aveia to Foruli on the Via Salaria. Another
road ran S.S.E. past Sulmo to Aesernia. It was thus an important
road centre, and must have been, in the imperial period,
a town of some size, as may be gathered from the inscriptions
that have been discovered there, and from the extent rather
than the importance of the buildings visible on the site (among
them may be noted the remains of two aqueducts), which has,
however, never been systematically excavated. Short accounts
of discoveries will be found in <i>Notizie degli Scavi</i>, <i>passim</i>, and a
museum, consisting chiefly of the contents of tombs, has been
formed at Pentima. In one corner of a large enclosed space
(possibly a <i>palaestra</i>) was constructed the church of S. Pelino.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
The present building dates from the 13th century, though its
origin may be traced to the end of the 5th when it was the
cathedral of the see of Valva, which appears to have been the
name of Corfinium at the close of the Roman period.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORFU<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (anc. and mod. Gr. <span class="grk" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span> or <span class="grk" title="Korkyra">&#922;&#972;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>, Lat. <i>Corcyra</i>),
an island of Greece, in the Ionian Sea, off the coast of Albania
or Epirus, from which it is separated by a strait varying in
breadth from less than 2 to about 15 m. The name Corfu is an
Italian corruption of the Byzantine <span class="grk" title="Koryphô">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#974;</span>, which is derived
from the Greek <span class="grk" title="Koryphai">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#945;&#943;</span> (crests). In shape it is not unlike the
sickle (<i>drepan&#275;</i>), to which it was compared by the ancients,&mdash;the
hollow side, with the town and harbour of Corfu in the centre,
being turned towards the Albanian coast. Its extreme length
is about 40 m. and its greatest breadth about 20. The area is
estimated at 227 sq. m., and the population in 1907 was 99,571,
of whom 28,254 were in the town and suburbs of Corfu. Two
high and well-defined ranges divide the island into three districts,
of which the northern is mountainous, the central undulating
and the southern low-lying. The most important of the two
ranges is that of San Salvador, probably the ancient Istone,
which stretches east and west from Cape St Angelo to Cape
St Stefano, and attains its greatest elevation of 3300 ft. in the
summit from which it takes its name. The second culminates in
the mountain of Santi Deca, or Santa Decca, as it is called by
misinterpretation of the Greek designation <span class="grk" title="hoi Hagioi Deka">&#959;&#7985; &#7948;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#953; &#916;&#941;&#954;&#945;</span>, or
the Ten Saints. The whole island, composed as it is of various
limestone formations, presents great diversity of surface, and
the prospects from the more elevated spots are magnificent.</p>

<p>Corfu is generally considered the most beautiful of all the
Greek isles, but the prevalence of the olive gives some monotony
to its colouring. It is worthy of remark that Homer names,
as adorning the garden of Alcinous, seven plants only&mdash;wild olive,
oil olive, pear, pomegranate, apple, fig and vine. Of these the
apple and the pear are now very inferior in Corfu; the others
thrive well and are accompanied by all the fruit trees known in
southern Europe, with addition of the Japanese medlar (or loquat),
and, in some spots, of the banana. When undisturbed by
cultivation, the myrtle, arbutus, bay and ilex form a rich
brushwood and the minor <i>flora</i> of the island is extensive.</p>

<p>The common form of laud tenure is the <i>colonia perpetua</i>, by
which the landlord grants a lease to the tenant and his heirs for
ever, in return for a rent, payable in kind, and fixed at a certain
proportion of the produce. Of old, a tenant thus obtaining half
the produce to himself was held to be co-owner of the soil to
the extent of one-fourth; and if he had three-fourths of the
crop, his ownership came to one-half. Such a tenant could
not be expelled except for non-payment, bad culture or the
transfer of his lease without the landlord&rsquo;s consent. Attempts
have been made to prohibit so embarrassing a system; but as
it is preferred by the agriculturists, the existing laws permit it.
The portion of the olive crop due to the landlord, whether by
<i>colonia</i> or ordinary lease, is paid, not according to the actual
harvest, but in keeping with the estimates of valuators mutually
appointed, who, just before the fruit is ripe, calculate how much
each tree will probably yield. The large old fiefs (<i>baronie</i>) in
Corfu, as in the other islands, have left their traces in the form
of quit-rents (known in Scotland by the name of feu-duties),
generally equal to one-tenth of the produce. But they have
been much subdivided, and the vassals may by law redeem them.
Single olive trees of first quality yield sometimes as much as
2 gallons of oil, and this with little trouble or expense beyond the
collecting and pressing of the fallen fruit. The trees grow
unrestrained, and some are not less than three hundred years old.
The vineyards are laboured by the broad heart-shaped hoe.
The vintage begins on the festival of Santa Croce, or the 26th of
September (O.S.). None of the Corfu wines is much exported.
The capital is the only city or town of much extent in the island;
but there are a number of villages, such as Benizze, Gasturi, Ipso,
Glypho, with populations varying from 300 to 1000. Near
Gasturi stands the Achilleion, the palace built for the Empress
Elizabeth of Austria, and purchased in 1907 by the German
emperor, William II.</p>

<p>The town of Corfu stands on the broad part of a peninsula,
whose termination in the citadel is cut from it by an artificial
fosse formed in a natural gully, with a salt-water ditch at the
bottom. Having grown up within fortifications, where every
foot of ground was precious, it is mostly, in spite of recent improvements,
a labyrinth of narrow, tortuous, up-and-down streets,
accommodating themselves to the irregularities of the ground,
few of them fit for wheel carriages. There is, however, a
handsome esplanade between the town and the citadel, and
a promenade by the seashore towards Castrades. The palace,
built by Sir Thomas Maitland (?1759-1824; lord high commissioner
of the Ionian Islands, 1815), is a large structure of
white Maltese stone. In several parts of the town may be found
houses of the Venetian time, with some traces of past splendour,
but they are few, and are giving place to structures in the modern
and more convenient French style. Of the thirty-seven Greek
churches the most important are the cathedral, dedicated to
Our Lady of the Cave (<span class="grk" title="hê Panagia Spêliôtissa">&#7969; &#928;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#943;&#945; &#931;&#960;&#951;&#955;&#953;&#974;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#945;</span>); St Spiridion&rsquo;s,
with the tomb of the patron saint of the island; and the suburban
church of St Jason and St Sosipater, reputed the oldest in the
island. The city is the seat of a Greek and a Roman Catholic
archbishop; and it possesses a gymnasium, a theatre, an
agricultural and industrial society, and a library and museum
preserved in the buildings formerly devoted to the university,
which was founded by Frederick North, 5th earl of Guilford
(1766-1827, himself the first chancellor in 1824,) in 1823, but
disestablished on the cessation of the English protectorate.
There are three suburbs of some importance&mdash;Castrades, Manduchio
and San Rocco. The old fortifications of the town,
being so extensive as to require a force of from 10,000 to 20,000
troops to man them, were in great part thrown down by the
English, and a simpler plan adopted, limiting the defences to
the island of Vido and the old citadel; these are now dismantled.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;According to the local tradition Corcyra was the
Homeric island of Scheria, and its earliest inhabitants the
Phaeacians. At a date no doubt previous to the foundation of
Syracuse it was peopled by settlers from Corinth, but it appears
to have previously received a stream of emigrants from Eretria.
The splendid commercial position of Corcyra on the highway
between Greece and the West favoured its rapid growth, and,
influenced perhaps by the presence of non-Corinthian settlers,
its people, quite contrary to the usual practice of Corinthian
colonies, maintained an independent and even hostile attitude
towards the mother city. This opposition came to a head in
the early part of the 7th century, when their fleets fought the
first naval battle recorded in Greek history (about 664 B.C.).
These hostilities ended in the conquest of Corcyra by the
Corinthian tyrant Periander (c. 600), who induced his new
subjects to join in the colonization of Apollonia and Anactorium.
The island soon regained its independence and henceforth
devoted itself to a purely mercantile policy. During the Persian
invasion of 480 it manned the second largest Greek fleet (60
ships), but took no active part in the war. In 435 it was again
involved in a quarrel with Corinth and sought assistance from
Athens. This new alliance was one of the chief immediate
causes of the Peloponnesian War (q.v.), in which Corcyra was
of considerable use to the Athenians as a naval station, but did
not render much assistance with its fleet. The island was nearly
lost to Athens by two attempts of the oligarchic faction to effect
a revolution; on each occasion the popular party ultimately
won the day and took a most bloody revenge on its opponents
(427 and 425). During the Sicilian campaigns of Athens
Corcyra served as a base for supplies; after a third abortive rising
of the oligarchs in 410 it practically withdrew from the war.
In 375 it again joined the Athenian alliance; two years later it
was besieged by a Lacedaemonian armament, but in spite of the
devastation of its flourishing countryside held out successfully
until relief was at hand. In the Hellenistic period Corcyra was
exposed to attack from several sides; after a vain siege by
Cassander it was occupied in turn by Agathocles and Pyrrhus.
It subsequently fell into the hands of Illyrian corsairs, until in
229 it was delivered by the Romans, who retained it as a naval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
station and gave it the rank of a free state. In 31 B.C. it served
Octavian (Augustus) as a base against Antony.</p>

<p>Eclipsed by the foundation of Nicopolis, Corcyra for a long
time passed out of notice. With the rise of the Norman kingdom
in Sicily and the Italian naval powers, it again became a frequent
object of attack. In 1081-1085 it was held by Robert Guiscard,
in 1147-1154 by Roger II. of Sicily. During the break-up of
the Later Roman Empire it was occupied by Genoese privateers
(1197-1207) who in turn were expelled by the Venetians. In
1214-1259 it passed to the Greek despots of Epirus, and in 1267
became a possession of the Neapolitan house of Anjou. Under
the latter&rsquo;s weak rule the island suffered considerably from the
inroads of various adventurers; hence in 1386 it placed itself
under the protection of Venice, which in 1401 acquired formal
sovereignty over it. Corcyra remained in Venetian hands till
1797, though several times assailed by Turkish armaments and
subjected to two notable sieges in 1536 and 1716-1718, in which
the great natural strength of the city again asserted itself. The
Venetian feudal families pursued a mild but somewhat enervating
policy towards the natives, who began to merge their nationality
in that of the Latins and adopted for the island the new name
of Corfu. The Corfiotes were encouraged to enrich themselves
by the cultivation of the olive, but were debarred from entering
into commercial competition with Venice. The island served
as a refuge for Greek scholars, and in 1732 became the home
of the first academy of modern Greece, but no serious impulse
to Greek thought came from this quarter.</p>

<p>By the treaty of Campo Formio Corfu was ceded to the French,
who occupied it for two years, until they were expelled by a
Russo-Turkish armament (1799). For a short time it became
the capital of a self-governing federation of the Hephtanesos
(&ldquo;Seven Islands&rdquo;); in 1807 its faction-ridden government
was again replaced by a French administration, and in 1809 it
was vainly besieged by a British fleet. When, by the treaty of
Paris of November 5, 1815, the Ionian Islands were placed under
the protectorate of Great Britain, Corfu became the seat of the
British high commissioner. The British commissioners, who
were practically autocrats in spite of the retention of the native
senate and assembly, introduced a strict method of government
which brought about a decided improvement in the material
prosperity of the island, but by its very strictness displeased the
natives. In 1864 it was, with the other Ionian Islands, ceded
to the kingdom of Greece, in accordance with the wishes of the
inhabitants. The island has again become an important point
of call and has a considerable trade in olive oil; under a more
careful system of tillage the value of its agricultural products
might be largely increased.</p>

<p>Corfu contains very few and unimportant remains of antiquity.
The site of the ancient city of Corcyra (<span class="grk" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>) is well ascertained,
about 1½ m. to the south-east of Corfu, upon the narrow piece
of ground between the sea-lake of Calichiopulo and the Bay of
Castrades, in each of which it had a port. The circular tomb of
Menecrates, with its well-known inscription, is on the Bay of
Castrades. Under the hill of Ascension are the remains of a
temple, popularly called of Neptune, a very simple Doric structure,
which still in its mutilated state presents some peculiarities
of architecture. Of Cassiope, the only other city of ancient importance,
the name is still preserved by the village of Cassopo,
and there are some rude remains of building on the site; but
the temple of Zeus Cassius for which it was celebrated has totally
disappeared. Throughout the island there are numerous
monasteries and other buildings of Venetian erection, of which
the best known are Paleocastrizza, San Salvador and Pelleka.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORI<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (anc. <i>Cora</i>), a town and episcopal see of the province of
Rome, Italy, 36 m. S.E. by rail from the town of Rome, on the
lower slopes of the Volscian mountains, 1300 ft. above sea-level.
Pop. (1901) 6463. It occupies the site of the ancient Volscian
town of Cora, the foundation of which is by classical authors
variously ascribed to Trojan settlers, to the Volscians (with a later
admixture of Latins), and to the Latins themselves. The last
is more probable (though in that case it was the only town of
the Prisci Latini in the Volscian hills), as it appears among the
members of the Latin league. Coins of Cora exist, belonging
at latest to 350-250 B.C. It was devastated by the partisans
of Marius during the struggle between him and Sulla. Before
the end of the Republic it had become a <i>municipium</i>. It lay
just above the older road from Velitrae to Terracina, which
followed the foot of the Volscian hills, but was 6 m. from the
Via Appia, and it is therefore little mentioned by classical
writers. It is comparatively often spoken of in the 4th century,
but from that time to the 13th we hear hardly anything of it,
as though it had almost ceased to exist. The remains of the
city walls are considerable: three different <i>enceintes</i>, one within
the other, enclose the upper and lower town and the acropolis.
They are built in Cyclopean work, and different parts vary considerably
in the roughness or fineness of the jointing and hewing
of the blocks; but explorations at Norba (q.v.) have proved that
inferences as to their relative antiquity based upon such considerations
are not to be trusted. There is a fine single-arched
bridge, now called the Ponte della Catena, just outside the town
on the way to Norba, to which an excessively early date is often
assigned.</p>

<p>At the summit of the town is a beautiful little Doric tetrastyle
temple, belonging probably to the 1st century B.C., built of
limestone with an inscription recording its erection by the
<i>duumviri</i>. It is not known to what deity it was dedicated; and
there is no foundation for the assertion that the porphyry
statue of Minerva (or Roma) now in front of the Palazzo del
Senatore, at Rome, was found here in the 16th century. Lower
down are two columns of a Corinthian temple dedicated to Castor
and Pollux, as the inscription records. The church of Santa
Oliva stands upon the site of a Roman building. The cloister,
constructed in 1466-1480, is in two storeys; the capitals of the
columns are finely sculptured by a Lombard artist (G. Giovannoni
in <i>L&rsquo;Arte</i>, 1906, p. 108). There are remains of several other
ancient buildings in the modern town, especially of a series of
large cisterns probably belonging to the imperial period. Some
interesting frescoes of the Roman school of the 15th century
are to be found in the chapel of the Annunziata outside the town
(F. Hermanin in <i>L&rsquo;Arte</i>, 1906, p. 45).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORIANDER,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> the fruit, improperly called seed, of an umbelliferous
plant (<i>Coriandrum sativum</i>), a native of the south of
Europe and Asia Minor, but cultivated in the south of England,
where it is also found as an escape, growing apparently wild.
The name is derived from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="koris">&#954;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#962;</span> (a bug), and was given
on account of its foetid, bug-like smell. The plant produces
a slender, erect, hollow stem rising 1 to 2 ft. in height, with
bipinnate leaves and small flowers in pink or whitish umbels.
The fruit is globular and externally smooth, having five indistinct
ridges, and the mericarps, or half-fruits, do not readily separate
from each other. It is used in medicine as an aromatic and
carminative, the active principle being a volatile oil, obtained
by distillation, which is isomeric with Borneo camphor, and may
be given in doses of ½ to 3 minims. On account of its pleasant
and pungent flavour it is a favourite ingredient in hot curries
and sauces. The fruit is also used in confectionery, and as a
flavouring ingredient in various liqueurs. The essential oil on
which its aroma depends is obtained from it by distillation.
The tender leaves and shoots of the young plant are used in
soups and salads.</p>

formerly the most important on this coast it has been silted up

ships is an industry at Tallarevu in the vicinity. In 1787 a
gale from the north-east occasioned an inundation which swept
away the greater part of Coringa with its inhabitants; and in
1832 another storm desolated the place, carrying vessels into
the fields and leaving them aground. Of Europeans the Dutch
were the first to establish themselves at Coringa. In 1759 the
English took possession of the town, and erected a factory 5 m.

<p><span class="bold">CORINTH,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> a city of Greece, situated near the isthmus (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Corinth, Isthmus of</a></span>) which connects Peloponnesus and central
Greece, and separates the Saronic and the Corinthian gulfs
on E. and W. The ancient town stood 1½ m. from the latter,
in a plain extending westward to Sicyon. The citadel, or Acrocorinthus,
rising precipitously on the S. to a height of 1886 ft.
was separated by a ravine from Oneium, a range of hills which
runs E. to the isthmus entrance. Between this ridge and the
offshoots of Geraneia opposite a narrow depression allowed of
easy transit across the Isthmus neck. The territory of Corinth
was mostly rocky and unfertile; but its position at the head
of two navigable gulfs clearly marked it out as a commercial
centre. Its natural advantages were enhanced by the &ldquo;Diolcus&rdquo;
or tram-road, by which ships could be hauled across the Isthmus.
It was connected in historic times with its western port of
Lechaeum by two continuous walls, with Cenchreae and Schoenus
on the east by chains of fortifications. The city walls attained
a circuit of 10 m.</p>

<p>I. <i>History.</i>&mdash;In mythology, Corinth (originally named Ephyre)
appears as the home of Medea, Sisyphus and Bellerophon, and
already has over-sea connexions which illustrate its primitive
commercial activity. Similarly the early presence of Phoenician
traders is attested by the survival of Sidonian cults (Aphrodite
Urania, Athena Phoenicice, Melicertes, i.e. Melkarth). In the
Homeric poems Corinth is a mere dependency of Mycenae;
nor does it figure prominently in the tradition of the Dorian
migrations. Though ultimately conquered by the invaders it
probably retained much of its former &ldquo;Ionian&rdquo; population,
whose god Poseidon continued to be worshipped at the national
Isthmian games throughout historic times; of the eight communal
tribes perhaps only three were Dorian. Under the new
dynasty of Aletes, which reigned according to tradition from
1074 to 747, Corinthian history continues obscure. The government
subsequently passed into the hands of a small corporation
of nobles descended from a former king Bacchis, and known as
the Bacchidae, who nominated annually a Prytanis (president)
from among their number. The maritime expansion of Corinth
at this time is proved by the foundation of colonies at Syracuse
and Corcyra, and the equipment of a fleet of triremes (the newly
invented Greek men-of-war) to quell a revolt of the latter city.</p>

<p>But Corinth&rsquo;s real prosperity dates from the time of the
tyranny (657-581), established by a disqualified noble Cypselus
(q.v.). and continued under his son Periander (q.v.). Under
these remarkable men, whose government was apparently mild,
the city rapidly developed. She extended her sphere of influence
throughout the coast-lands of the western gulf; by the settlement
of numerous colonies in N.W. Greece she controlled the
Italian and Adriatic trade-routes and secured a large share of
the commerce with the western Greeks. In Levantine waters
connexions grew up with the great marts of Chalcis and Miletus,
with the rulers of Lydia, Phrygia, Cyprus and Egypt. As an
industrial centre Corinth achieved pre-eminence in pottery,
metal-work and decorative handicraft, and was the reputed
&ldquo;inventor&rdquo; of painting and tiling; her bronze and her pottery,
moulded from the soft white clay of Oneium, were widely
exported over the Mediterranean. The chief example of her
early art was the celebrated &ldquo;chest of Cypselus&rdquo; at Olympia,
of carved cedar and ivory inlaid with gold. The city was enriched
with notable temples and public works (see § <i>Archaeology</i>), and
became the home of several Cyclic poets and of Arion, the
perfecter of the dithyramb.</p>

<p>The tyranny was succeeded by an oligarchy based upon a
graduated money qualification, which ruled with a consistency
equalling that of the Venetian Council, but pursued a policy
too purely commercial to the neglect of military efficiency.
Late in the 6th century Corinth joined the Peloponnesian league
under Sparta, in which her financial resources and strategic
position secured her an unusual degree of independence. Thus
the city successfully befriended the Athenians against
Cleomenes I. (q.v.), and supported them against Aegina, their
common commercial rival in eastern waters. In the great
Persian war of 480 Corinth served as the Greek headquarters:
her army took part at Thermopylae and Plataea and her navy
distinguished itself at Salamis and Mycale. Later in the century
the rapid development of Athenian trade and naval power
became a serious menace. In 459 the Corinthians, in common
with their former rivals the Aeginetans, made war upon Athens,
but lost both by sea and land. Henceforward their Levantine
commerce dwindled, and in the west the Athenians extended
their rivalry even into the Corinthian Gulf. Though Syracuse
remained friendly, and the colonies in the N.W. maintained a
close commercial alliance with the mother-city, the disaffection of
Corcyra hampered the Italian trade. The alliance of this latter
power with Athens accentuated the rising jealousy of the
Corinthians, who, after deprecating a federal war in 440, virtually
forced Sparta&rsquo;s hand against Athens in 432. In the subsequent
war Corinth displayed great activity in the face of heavy losses,
and the support she gave to Syracuse had no little influence
on the ultimate issue of the war (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peloponnesian War</a></span>).
In 395 the domineering attitude of Sparta impelled the
Corinthians to conclude an alliance with Argos which they had
previously contemplated on occasions of friction with the former
city, as well as with Thebes and with Athens, whose commercial
rivalry they no longer dreaded. In the ensuing &ldquo;Corinthian
War&rdquo; the city suffered severely, and the war-party only maintained
itself by the help of an Argive garrison and a formal
annexation to Argos. Since 387 the Spartan party was again
supreme, and after Leuctra Corinth took the field against the
Theban invaders of Peloponnesus (371-366). In 344 party
struggles between oligarchs and democrats led to a usurpation
by the tyrant Timophanes, whose speedy assassination was
compassed by his brother Timoleon (q.v.).</p>

<p>After the campaign of Chaeronea, Philip II. of Macedon
summoned a Greek congress at Corinth and left a garrison on
the citadel. This citadel, one of the &ldquo;fetters of Greece,&rdquo; was
eagerly contended for by the Macedonian pretenders after
Alexander&rsquo;s death; ultimately it fell to Antigonus Gonatas,
who controlled it through a tyrant. In 243 Corinth was freed
by Aratus and incorporated into the Achaean league. After a
short Spartan occupation in 224 it was again surrendered to
Macedonia. T. Quinctius Flamininus, after proclaiming the
liberty of Greece at the Isthmus, restored Corinth to the league
(196). With the revival of its political and commercial importance
the city became the centre of resistance against Rome.
In return for the foolish provocation of war in 146 B.C. the Roman
conquerors despoiled Corinth of its art treasures and destroyed
the entire settlement: the land was partly made over to Sicyon
and partly became public domain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span></p>

<p>In 46 Julius Caesar repeopled Corinth with Italian freedmen
and dispossessed Greeks. Under its new name <i>Laus Julii</i> and
an Italian constitution it rapidly recovered its commercial
prosperity. Augustus made it the capital of Achaea; Hadrian
enriched it with public works. Its prosperity, as also its profligacy,
is attested by the New Testament, by Strabo and
Pausanias. After the Gothic raids of 267 and 395 Corinth was
secured by new fortifications at the Isthmus. Though restricted
to the citadel, the medieval town became the administrative
and ecclesiastical capital of Peloponnesus, and enjoyed a thriving
trade and silk industry until in 1147 it was sacked by the
Normans. In 1210 it was joined to the Latin duchy of the
Morea, and subsequently was contended for by various Italian
pretenders. Since the Turkish conquest (1459) the history of
Corinth has been uneventful, save for a raid by the Maltese in
1611 and a Venetian occupation from 1687 to 1715.</p>

<p>II. <i>Archaeology and Modern Town.</i>&mdash;The modern town of New
Corinth, the head of a district in the province of Corinth (pop.
71,229), is situated on the Isthmus of Corinth near the south-eastern
recess of the Gulf of Corinth, 3½ m. N.E. from the site
of the ancient city. It was founded in 1858, when Old Corinth
was destroyed by an earthquake. It is connected by railway
with Athens (57 m.), with Patras (80 m.), and with Nauplia
(40 m.), the capital of Argolis. Communication by sea with
Athens, Patras, the Ionian Islands and the shores of the
Ambracian Gulf, is constant since the opening of the Corinthian
ship canal, in 1893. It has not, however, attained great prosperity.
It has broad streets and low houses, but is architecturally
unattractive, like most of the creations of the time of
King Otto. Its chief exports are seedless grapes (&ldquo;currants&rdquo;),
olive-oil, silk and cereals. Pop. (1905) about 4300.</p>

<p>Old Corinth passed through its various stages, Greek, Roman,
Byzantine, Turkish. After the War of Liberation it was again
Greek, and, being a considerable town, was suggested as the
capital of the new kingdom of Greece. The earthquake of 1858
levelled it to the ground with the exception of about a dozen
houses. A mere handful of the old inhabitants remained on the
site. But fertile fields and running water made it attractive;
and outsiders gradually came in. At present it is an untidy,
poverty-stricken village of about 1000 inhabitants, mostly of
Albanian blood. Like the ancient city, it spreads out over two
terraces, one about 100 ft. above the other. These were formed
in different geological ages by the gulf, which had in historical
times receded to a distance of 1¼ m. from the city. At the nearest
point to the city was laid out the harbour, Lechaeum, a basin dug
far into the shore and joined with the city by long walls. At
about the middle of the two terraces, 1½ m. long, the edge of the
upper one was worn back into a deep indentation, probably
by running water, possibly by quarrying. Here was the heart
of the ancient city. At the lower end of the indentation is the
modern public square, shaded by a gigantic and picturesque
plane tree, nourished by the surplus water of Pirene. As the
visitor looks from the square up the indentation he sees on a
height to the right a venerable temple ruin, and, directly in front,
Acro-Corinth, rising over 1500 ft. above the village. Even from
the village, the view over the gulf, including Parnassus with its
giant neighbours on the N., Cyllene and its neighbours on the
W., and Geraneia on the N.E., is very fine. But from Acro-Corinth
the view is still finer, and is perhaps unsurpassed in
Greece.</p>

<p>The excavations begun in 1896 by the American school of
Classical Studies at Athens, under the direction of Rufus B.
Richardson, have brought to light important monuments of
the ancient city, both Greek and Roman.</p>

<p>The first object was the locating of the agora, or public square,
first because Pausanias says that most of the important monuments
of the city were either on or near the agora; and secondly
because, beginning with the agora, he mentions, sometimes with
a brief description, the principal monuments in order along three
of the principal thoroughfares radiating from it. In the first
year&rsquo;s work twenty-one trial trenches were dug in the hope
of finding a clue to its position. Somewhat less than a quarter
of a mile to the N.W. of the temple, set back into the edge of the
upper terrace, there was found, under 20 ft. of soil, a ruined
Roman theatre built upon the ruins of a Greek theatre. This
theatre was, according to Pausanias, on the street leading from
the agora towards Sicyon, and so to the west of the agora.
Another trench dug across the deep indentation to the E. of the
temple revealed a broad limestone pavement leading from the
very northern edge of the city up through the indentation, in
the direction of Acro-Corinth. It required little sagacity to
identify it with the street mentioned by Pausanias as leading
from the agora towards Lechaeum. It was practically certain
that by following up this pavement to its point of intersection
with the road from Sicyon the agora would be discovered.</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img style="border:0; width:525px; height:712px"
     src="images/img148.jpg"
     alt="" />
</div>

<p>The limestone pavement, with long porches on either side, was
found to stop at the foot of a marble staircase of thirty-four
steps of Byzantine construction, underneath which appeared a
Roman arrangement of the two flights with a platform halfway
up. The top flight led up to the propylaea. The remains of the
propylaea above ground are few; but the foundations are
massive and well laid, at the end of the upper terrace where it
is farthest worn back. These foundations are clearly those of
a Roman triumphal arch, which perhaps took the name &ldquo;propylaea&rdquo;
from an ancient Greek structure on the same spot. This
arch appears on Roman coins from Augustus to Commodus;
according to Pausanias it bore two four-horse chariots, one
driven by Helios and the other by Phaethon, his son, all in gilded
bronze.</p>

<p>Although a considerable part of the agora has been excavated,
none of the statues which Pausanias saw in it have been discovered.
On the upper (S.) side are excellent foundations of
a long porch. On the N. side, stretching westward from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
propylaea, are two porches of different periods. The older one,
which still existed in Roman times, was backed up against the
temple hill, which was cut away to make room for it. An ancient
staircase, 15 ft. broad, led down from the temple hill into the
lower area of the broad pavement, from which access to the agora
and the Pirene was easy.</p>

<p>To the E. of the paved road and close up against the agora
itself, only at a much lower level, was found, buried under
35 ft. of earth, the famous fountain Pirene, tallying exactly
with the description of Pausanias, as &ldquo;a series of chambers that
are like caves, and bearing a façade of white marble.&rdquo; This
Pirene originally had a two-storey façade of Roman fashion
made of limestone, but, before the time of Pausanias, it had
received a covering of marble which has now fallen off, but has
left traces of itself in the holes drilled into the limestone, in the
rough hacking away of the half columns, and in the numerous
marble fragments which lay in front of the façade. This was not,
however, the earliest form of Pirene. It was built up in front of
a more simple Greek fountain-structure which consisted of seven
cross-walls placed under the edge of the stratum forming the
upper terrace. Six chambers were thus formed which showed
the chaste beauty of Greek workmanship, while the stratum
of native rock which covered them gave a touch of nature and
made them caves. The walls ended at the front in the form of an
<i>anta</i> delicately carved. On a parapet at the rear of each chamber
a single slender Ionic column between two <i>antae</i> supported an
Ionic entablature. The stuccoed walls were striped horizontally
and vertically with red on a blue field, on which appear fishes
swimming. The chambers were really reservoirs, filled by the
water which flowed along their backs.</p>

<p>We know nothing further about the Greek system, but in
the Roman adjustment the water was led from this series of
cisterns into a large rectangular basin which formed the centre of
a quadrangle 50 ft. square. In the N.E. corner is a hole through
which it was drained, and at the N. end a flight of five steps led
down into it. Besides the four orifices through which water
flowed into it there were two other holes about 4 in. lower down
to keep the basin from overflowing. Two uses of water are
mentioned by Pausanias, &ldquo;The water,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was sweet
to drink,&rdquo; and also good for tempering bronze. It seems clear
then, that the basin was at stated times used for the latter
purpose, and was converted into a tank. The bronze was
plunged into the water in a red hot condition, and thus acquired
its peculiar excellence.</p>

<p>In Byzantine times five columns, of various diameters, with
no two bases of the same size, bearing Corinthian capitals, were
set up about 6 ft. in front of the façade. Blocks of marble
which had seen use elsewhere ran from them back into the
façade, which was hacked away in rough fashion to receive them.
Probably these blocks formed the floor of a balcony, a tawdry
marble addition.</p>

<p>Pirene was at all times the heart of the city. Here it was that
Athena helped Bellerophon to bridle Pegasus; and hence she
received the epithet of &ldquo;the Bridler,&rdquo; Chalinitis. The importance
of the fountain is attested by the fact that the Greek poets and
the Delphic oracle instead of saying Corinth said, &ldquo;the city of
Pirene.&rdquo; That it was a place of common resort is shown by
Euripides (<i>Medea</i>, 68 f.), where it is said that the elders were to be
found &ldquo;near the august waters of Pirene, playing draughts
(<span class="grk" title="pessoi">&#960;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#943;</span>).&rdquo; The quadrangle, with its walls 20 ft. high, and its
three apses probably covered with half domes, provided considerable
shade. There is reason for supposing that the marble
coating of the façade, and perhaps the erection of the quadrangle,
also covered with marble, were the work of Herodes Atticus,
and therefore just completed when Pausanias saw them. A base
on which stood a statue of Herodes&rsquo; wife, Regilla, was found
close to the façade, inscribed with fulsome praise, stating that
the statue was &ldquo;set up by order of the Sisyphaean Senate at
the outpouring of the streams.&rdquo; Two inscriptions of Roman
times make the identity of Pirene certain, if there could be any
doubt in the face of the exact agreement of Pausanias&rsquo;s description
with the structure.</p>

<p>Of the surviving monuments of the Greek city the most
important is the temple of Apollo. While it was probably badly
wrecked by the Romans at the sack of the city, its massive
columns with the entablature survived. That it was restored
and was in use in Roman time is shown by the fact that both
the seven columns still standing and two fallen columns discovered
in the excavations, to say nothing of several fragments
of others, have a thick coating of Roman stucco laid over the
finer Greek. The style of the temple points to 600 B.C., when
Periander was at the height of his power. According to
Herodotus he made his doubtful adherents deposit pledges of
faithfulness in the temple of Apollo. Quite near the W. end of
the temple is the fountain Glauc&#275; cut out of a cube of rock,
apparently left standing when the material for the temple was
quarried around it. In it were carved out four chambers or
reservoirs all connected and a porch consisting of three pillars
between two <i>antae</i> in which the side walls ended. The water
coming down from Acro-Corinth was introduced from behind.
Approached by a flight of steps partly rock-cut, it had at the
rear of the porch a balustrade with marble lions&rsquo; heads through
which the water overflowed. Two of these heads were found.
The top of the system of reservoirs was too heavy for the slender
cross walls and pillars, only the stumps of which remain; a
collapse took place, by which the porch and the W. compartment
were carried away. From its location only about 50 yds. from
the temple it seems to have been the temple fountain. It was
named after the second wife of Jason, Glauc&#275;, who plunged into
it to quench the fire of the poisoned bridal garments given her
by Medea.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that monuments were found of which there
is no record in ancient writings. Such was a very ancient
fountain W. of the propylaea, 25 ft. below the surface. Under
remains of the Roman city appeared a triglyphon of porous stone
with an extent from N. to S. of about 30 ft. At the N. end it
turned westward at an obtuse angle and extended about 10 ft.
in that direction. The system is about 4 ft. high. While the
colours on the metopes and triglyphs had faded somewhat,
the border above them, topped with a cornice projecting 6 in.,
retained a most brilliant maeander pattern of red, blue and
yellow, while below these were two bands of godroons of blue and
red. On the top of this system as a foundation were set several
statue bases, one bearing the signature of Lysippus, which shows
that the system stood there at least as early as the 4th century
B.C. Some parts of it may have been taken from older buildings,
but not the cornice nor the corner metope block which formed
an obtuse angle. Near the middle of the long side is an opening;
and from it a flight of seven steps led down to a trapezoidal
chamber, on the back wall of which are two lions&rsquo; heads of bronze,
through which water, conducted in long semi-cylindrical channels
of bronze, from behind the wall, poured out into pitchers for
which holes are cut in the floor. Channels for the overflow were
cut along the back and sides of the chamber. All this was
once approached from the front at the level of the floor, long
before the triglyphon was set up, 7 ft. above it. Considering
its depth this fountain must be dated back to the 5th century,
probably near the beginning. The style of the lions&rsquo; heads would
hardly admit a later date. This is the only case of an ancient
Greek fountain of such an early date, unaltered and intact.
The pains taken to preserve it suggest that it was invested with
a sacred character.</p>

<p>Sculptures in large numbers, both of the Greek city and the
Roman, are collected in the new museum erected by the Greek
government near the plane tree. The finest of the Greek
sculptures is the head of a youth found in the orchestra of the
theatre at a depth of 23 ft. It lacks only the lower part of the
bridge of the nose, and has style and character, resembling
Myron&rsquo;s heads in shape and in the hair. A large fragment of a
relief also of early date, represents two dancing maenads half
life-size. Most impressive is a colossal female figure of grand
style and excellent drapery. If not an original of the 5th century
it is one of the finest of copies. Of the great amount of Roman
sculpture the best single piece is a head of Dionysus under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
influence of wine, crowned with a wreath of ivy, his right hand
thrown carelessly over his head. The fine execution is all that
differentiates it from the numerous copies in various museums.
The most important sculptures of the Roman period, however,
are a group of colossal figures supporting an entablature, a
large part of which has been recovered. One of the figures,
a barbarian captive, effeminate like those which appear on
Roman triumphal arches, is practically intact. Another, its
counterpart, is preserved down to the hips. These differ from
Caryatids, which bear the architrave on their heads. Here a
pilaster forming the back of the figure receives a Corinthian
capital, upon which the architrave rests; and the figures merely
brace up the pilaster. Two of these figures stood at the end of
a re-entrant curve, several pieces of which are preserved. Two
female heads of like proportions belong to the system, since the
backs of their heads are cut away in the same manner as the
male heads. The building to which the figures belonged, a
porch, extended westward from the propylaea; and may be
traced for 45 ft. All that is left of it is the core of <i>opus incertum</i>.</p>

<p>The excavations brought to light vases and fragments of vases,
of nearly every period except the Mycenaean. On the N. side
of the hill on which stands the village schoolhouse, from which
one looks across the indentation to the Apollo temple, several
vertical shafts in the limestone stratum were found, and underneath
it in horizontal passages were bodies surrounded with
vases. These are pre-Mycenaean, and their only ornament
is scratches, into which white matter has been pressed. There
are over fifty of these vases, of multiform shapes. By the side
of the Lechaeum road, near the steps leading to the propylaea,
were found in deep diggings thirteen early Geometric vases.
Proto-Corinthian vases also were everywhere strongly represented.
The best find of pottery, however, was an Old Corinthian celeb&#275;
(<span class="grk" title="kelebê">&#954;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#946;&#951;</span>, drinking vessel), about a foot high, in forty-six fragments,
found in a well, 30 ft. below the surface. On one side are a boar
and a leopard confronting each other, and on the other side two
cocks in the same heraldic arrangement. On the projecting
plates supported by the handles are palmettes.</p>

<p>Two inscriptions in the Old Corinthian alphabet came to light.
But, on the whole, inscriptions before the Roman times were
almost entirely lacking. One inscription, though of late date,
deserves mention. On a marble block broken away at both ends,
which in a second use was a lintel, we read <span class="grk" title="AGÔGÊEBR">&#913;&#915;&#937;&#915;&#919;&#917;&#914;&#929;</span>, which
can only be <span class="grk" title="synagôgê Hebraiôn">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#8052; &#7961;&#946;&#961;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957;</span> (synagogue of the Hebrews).</p>

<p>The excavations were confined to a small part of the city,
but there is little doubt that it was the most important part.
By good fortune the earth here was very deep. On the higher level
of the agora and the Apollo temple, where the depth of earth
is comparatively slight, there is little hope of important finds.
There is no hope of finding the great bronze Athena, which stood
in the middle of the agora. To the west, beyond the theatre, one
might find the temple of Athena Chalinitis and the fountain
Lerna, and somewhere near Glauce, the Odeum and the tomb
of Medea&rsquo;s children; but it is more likely that they have disappeared.
On the Lechaeum road, on which a bewildering
wealth of fountains and statues is enumerated, only the Baths
of Eurycles below the plane tree were found; deep diggings
were made into them, and the foundations of the façade laid
bare. This great complex was apparently supplied with water
from Hadrian&rsquo;s aqueduct from Lake Stymphalus. On the street
going eastward from the agora nothing is mentioned between
it and the city wall. This level eastern part was probably given
up to fine houses, all traces of which have perished. Outside
the gate, apparently, was the famous Craneion, shaded by
cypress trees, and near it the tombs of Lais and Diogenes, a
precinct of Bellerophon and of Athena Melaenis. The
number of temples and shrines enumerated by Pausanias
along the road leading up to Acro-Corinth is bewildering.
Here were represented Isis and Serapis, Helios, the Mother of
the Gods, the Fates, Demeter and Persephone; but no trace
of these temples remains. At the highest point of the road,
according to Pausanias, there stood the famous temple of
Aphrodite, but the remains excavated at this point seem to be
those of a late tower, and the few foundations below it do not
resemble those of a temple. We are equally unfortunate in
regard to Strabo&rsquo;s splendid marble Sisyphaeum just below
the summit. The fountain Pirene, &ldquo;behind the temple,&rdquo; still
exists, but so much earth has accumulated about it that one
now approaches it by going down a ladder. The water is so
crystal clear that one inadvertently steps into it. The identity
of name with that of Pirene in the city is justified by the fact
that the upper spring is the source of the Pirene below.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORINTH,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Alcorn county,
Mississippi, U.S.A., situated in the N.E. part of the state, about
90 m. E. by S. of Memphis, Tennessee. Pop.(1890) 2111; (1900)
3661 (1174 negroes); (1910) 5020. It is served by the Mobile
&amp; Ohio and the Southern railways; and by a branch of the
Illinois Central connecting Jackson, Miss., and Birmingham,
Ala. It has woollen mills, cotton compresses, clothing,
furniture, and spoke and stave factories and machine shops,
and is a cotton market. Because of its situation and its importance
as a railway junction, Corinth played an important part
in the western campaigns of the Civil War. After the first Confederate
line of defence had been broken by the capture of Fort
Henry and Fort Donelson (February 1862), Corinth was fortified
by General P. G. T. Beauregard, and was made the centre of the
new line along the Memphis &amp; Charleston railway, &ldquo;the great
East and West artery of the Confederacy.&rdquo; Grant&rsquo;s advance
on this centre, then defended by General A. S. Johnston, led to
the battle of Shiloh, fought on April 6/7 about 20 m. N.E. of
Corinth; after this engagement Beauregard withdrew to Corinth.
General H. W. Halleck, with a greatly superior force, cautiously
and slowly advanced upon the Confederate position, consuming
more than a month in the operation. During the night of the
29th of May Beauregard evacuated the place (which was occupied
by the Federals on the following day), and re-established his line
at Tupelo. Corinth then became the headquarters of the Union
forces under General W. S. Rosecrans, who on the 3/4 of October
1862 was fiercely attacked here by General Earl von Dorn, whom
he repulsed, both sides suffering considerable losses in killed and
wounded, and the Confederates leaving many prisoners behind.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORINTH, ISTHMUS OF,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> an isthmus of Greece, dividing the
Gulf of Corinth from the Saronic Gulf. Ships were sometimes
dragged across it in ancient times at a place called the Diolcus
(<span class="grk" title="dielkein">&#948;&#953;&#941;&#955;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to pull or cut through). Nero, in A.D. 67, began cutting
a canal through it; but the project was abandoned. In 1893
a ship canal was opened, with its western entrance about 1¼ m.
N.E. of the little town of New Corinth. It was begun in 1881
by a French company, which ceased operations in 1889, a Greek
company completing the undertaking. The canal is about
70 ft. broad, nearly 4 m. long, and 26 ft. deep. It shortens the
journey from the Adriatic to the Peiraeus by 202 m., but foreign
steamships seldom use it, as the narrowness of the canal and the
strength of the current at times render the passage dangerous.
About 1 m. from its western end it is crossed by the iron bridge
of the Athens and Corinth railway. Traces of the Isthmian wall
may still be seen parallel to the canal; it was constructed, at an
unknown date, for the fortification of the Isthmus. Just to the
S. of it, and about ½ m. from the sea are the remains of the
Isthmian precinct of Poseidon and its stadium, where the
Isthmian games were celebrated. This precinct served also
as a fortress. Within it have been found traces of the temple
of Poseidon and other buildings.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORINTHIANS, EPISTLES TO THE,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> two books of the Bible
(New Testament). The two letters addressed to the Christian
church at Corinth are, with Romans, the longest of the Pauline
epistles. They possess a singular interest and value, due to the
apostle&rsquo;s close acquaintance with the members of the church
addressed and their circumstances. In consequence of this
intimate character the First Epistle to the Corinthians presents
a picture, unrivalled in fulness and colour, of the life of a Pauline
church, while the Second Epistle, written out of strong feeling,
gives a revelation of the innermost feelings and characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>
temperament of Paul himself, such as is not elsewhere to be found.
Dealing, as both epistles do, with concrete problems of morals
and with such tendencies of thought and life as find their parallel
in all times, they are full of instruction to the modern Church;
and this instruction increases in effectiveness the better we come
to understand ancient modes of thought in their diversity from
our own.</p>

<p>Lofty and vivid expression of the apostle&rsquo;s thought on the
highest themes is also to be found here&mdash;witness the &ldquo;Hymn
to Love&rdquo; (1 Cor. xiii.), the declaration of the resurrection
(1 Cor. xv. 51-57), or the list of signatures of the true servant
of God (2 Cor. vi. 3-10). In important historical statements,
also, these epistles stand second to none, not even to Galatians&mdash;as
may be indicated by a reference to the words about the institution
of the Lord&rsquo;s supper (1 Cor. xi. 23-26) and the death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Cor. xv. 1-8); or to the autobiographical
utterances in which Paul explains that he was once
a persecutor of Christians (1 Cor. xv. 9), mentions his escape from
Damascus (2 Cor. xi. 32 f.), describes his coming to Corinth
(1 Cor. ii. 1 ff.), enumerates his sufferings for the Gospel (2 Cor.
xi. 16-31), tells of his visions (2 Cor. xii. 1-9). In the Corinthian
epistles we come in contact, as nowhere else, with the man Paul
and his daily life.</p>

<p>The history of Paul&rsquo;s relations with Corinth can be made out
from the Acts and the Epistles with considerable clearness.
The chronology of Paul&rsquo;s life is not at any point surely determinable
within a range of less than five years, but it must have been
in the autumn of one of the years A.D. 49-53 (the usual chronology
has fixed on A.D. 52) that the arrival of Paul in Corinth took
place as described in Acts xviii. 1. In his so-called second
missionary journey Paul had been driven by irresistible inner
impulses to push on into Greece the missionary work already
begun in Asia Minor. First he preached in the province of
Macedonia, where the work opened auspiciously at Philippi,
Thessalonica and Beroea; then, apparently driven out by the
violent opposition of the Jews, he moved on to Achaea, and after
rather unsuccessful attempts to secure converts among the
philosophers of Athens came to Corinth.</p>

<p>This ancient city, taken and destroyed by the Romans in
146 B.C., had been refounded by Julius Caesar as a Roman
colony in 46 B.C., settled with Italian colonists, and made a
residence of the Roman governor. Its situation on the isthmus
of Corinth made it a stage on the greatest of the trade routes
between Rome and the East, and it was at this time the commercial
capital of Greece. The traditions of licentiousness and
sensuality associated with the worship of Aphrodite, which had
given rise to the sinister word <i>corinthianize</i>, increased the natural
tendencies of a great city to wickedness and wanton luxury.
Here, as in all great centres of trade and industry, there was a
body of Jews, with a synagogue. The conditions of life in
Corinth&mdash;the heathen surroundings, the temptations to vice,
the competition and disputes of trading life, the controversial
arguments of Jews, the alertness of mind of a lively city people,
the haughty temper of the inhabitants of the capital&mdash;all these
are to be seen reflected in the earnest paragraphs of Paul&rsquo;s
two epistles.</p>

<p>The founding of the church in Corinth (cf. 1 Cor. iv. 15) and
nearly everything important that we know of Paul&rsquo;s first visit
there will be found, well told, in Acts xviii. 1-18, a passage for
which, evidently, the writer of the history had excellent sources
of information. Of the somewhat chastened spirit with which
Paul came he himself tells in 1 Cor. ii. 1-5. His success was
prompt and large, and in the year and six months of his stay
a vigorous church was gathered, including Aquila and Priscilla,
as well as Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, of whom we hear
again in 1 Cor. i. 14; whether Sosthenes, who seems to have
succeeded Crispus in his office (Acts xviii. 17), was afterwards
converted and became the Christian brother mentioned in
i Cor. i. 1 cannot be known. The church evidently consisted
mainly of Gentile converts, but with some Jews (i Cor. x. 14,
&ldquo;flee from idolatry&rdquo;; xii. 2, &ldquo;when ye were Gentiles &ldquo;; vii. 18,
&ldquo;was any man called being circumcised?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The apostle&rsquo;s next long stay was at Ephesus, whither he seems
to have gone in the course of the same year in which he left
Corinth (A.D. 51-55) and where he stayed three years. Before
he arrived at Ephesus Aquila and Priscilla, who had settled
there, made the acquaintance of Apollos, a Jew from Alexandria,
well-educated and zealous, who with imperfect Christian knowledge
was preaching the gospel of Jesus to his fellow-countrymen
in the synagogue. He presently went to Corinth and carried
on Christian work there with success (Acts xviii. 24-28), &ldquo;I
planted,&rdquo; says Paul (1 Cor. iii. 6), &ldquo;Apollos watered.&rdquo; From
this point on our information comes from the epistles, of which
the first was written from Ephesus before Pentecost of the year
in which Paul left that city, i.e. A.D. 54-58 (1 Cor. xvi. 8).</p>

<p>It appears that the church grew in numbers, for Paul refers
in 2 Cor. i. 1 to &ldquo;saints who are in all Achaea.&rdquo; Its membership
was mostly of humble people (1 Cor. i. 26-29), but probably
not exclusively so, for Crispus and Stephanas (who with his
household was able to render services that may well have been
costly, 1 Cor. xvi. 15), Gaius and Erastus (Rom. xvi. 23), would
appear to have been persons of substance. The references to
law-suits perhaps imply fairly prosperous traders, the tone of
the letters suggests considerable education and a reasonable
degree of property on the part of many (though not all) of the
readers.</p>

<p>The first need of the church for help from Paul seems to have
grown out of the dangers from surrounding heathenism. In
1 Cor. v. 9 we read of a letter in which Paul had directed the
Christians &ldquo;not to have company with fornicators.&rdquo; This
letter, so far as we know, opened the correspondence which
was maintained during the three years of Paul&rsquo;s stay in Ephesus,
whence there was easy and frequent communication with
Corinth. He refers to it in order to explain the injunction which
had been (perhaps wilfully) misunderstood and exaggerated.<a name="FnAnchor_1b" id="FnAnchor_1b" href="#Footnote_1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>While at Ephesus Paul was visited by persons of the household
of Chloe (1 Cor. i. 11), and by Stephanas with Fortunatus and
Achaicus (probably his slaves, xvi. 17). From them and from a
letter (vii. 1), which was brought perhaps by Stephanas, he was
able to gain the intimate knowledge which the epistles everywhere
reveal. The letter from Corinth must have contained inquiries
as to practical conduct with regard to marriage (vii. 1), meat
offered to idols (viii. 1), and the &ldquo;spiritual gifts&rdquo; (xii. 1), and
may well have related to other matters, such as the collection
of money for Jerusalem (xvi. 1), the visit of Apollos (xvi. 12),
the position of women (xi. 2). Paul&rsquo;s reply includes many
other topics. When it was sent, his trusted helper Timothy
had also started on his way (probably through Macedonia) to
Corinth, to contribute there to the edification of the Christians
(iv. 17, xvi. 10). The letter itself was doubtless sent by the hand
of returning Corinthians, possibly by the unnamed brethren
referred to in xvi. 11, and was expected to arrive before Timothy.</p>

<p><i>First Epistle.</i>&mdash;The first epistle (in many respects the most
systematic of all Paul&rsquo;s letters) is a pastoral letter, dealing both
with positive evils that need correction, and with difficult
questions of practice and of thought upon which advice may be
valued. Through it all there is a genial undercurrent of confidence
in the personal loyalty of the Corinthian church to Paul,
its founder and father. We shall be aided to understand its
contents by a brief summary of the tendencies and conditions
at Corinth which it reflects.</p>

<p>First of all there was a lack of supreme devotion to the Cause
itself, which led the Corinthians to forget that they were first,
last and always Christians, and so to form factions and parties.
Of these there were distinguished at least three, attached to
the names respectively of the founder Paul, of the learned
Apollos, and of the great pillar-apostle at Jerusalem, Peter,
besides, as many hold, a fourth, which arrogantly claimed to be
the party of Christ (i. 12). What were the precise motives and
principles of these parties cannot be determined. They do not
in any case seem to represent recognizable definite points of view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
with regard to the controverted matters that are taken up in the
epistle. Yet some conjectures are possible. Paul and Apollos
were personally on friendly terms (xvi. 12, cf. iii. 5-9, iv. 6),
and were understood to be in fundamental agreement. But
doubtless the more elaborate discourses of Apollos were admired,
and Paul&rsquo;s teaching seemed in contrast bare, plain and crude
(cf. 2 Cor. x. 10). The contrast between the Hellenic and Jewish
types of thought may well have played a part also. Paul seems
to be replying to such criticisms brought against him when he
declares that he deliberately chose to bring to Corinth not the
&ldquo;wisdom of men&rdquo; but the &ldquo;power of God&rdquo; (i. 17, ii. 1-5), and
informs them that he has a store of wisdom for those who are
ready for it (ii. 6). On the other hand the party of Cephas must
have had Jewish-Christian leanings. A little later, in the second
epistle, such a tendency is seen breaking out into violent opposition
to Paul. The &ldquo;Christ-party,&rdquo; if, as is probable, it existed,
must also have been a party with a Judaizing turn (cf. 2 Cor. x.
7, xi. 22 f.), perhaps of a more extreme character. The danger
of shattering the solid front of the Christian church against
surrounding heathenism was keenly felt by Paul, as nearly
every one of his epistles testifies. How serious it was at Corinth
is shown by the long passage (chaps, i.-iv.) in which he points
out that sectarianism is a mark not of superior but of inferior
maturity and devotion.</p>

<p>Other difficulties arose from various causes. The influences of
the heathen world, from which most of the Corinthian Christians
had come and to which their friends and neighbours belonged,
were always with them, and the problems created by these relations
were very numerous. Christianity had brought over
and had even intensified the moral code of Judaism, and, especially
in the relations of the sexes, this brought a strain upon the
naturalistic impulses and lower standards of converts trained
in a different system.</p>

<p>Again, there were law-suits in the ordinary courts, a natural
result of the frictions and strains of an oriental trading community.
To Paul this was abhorrent, and here too he urges a
complete break with their past. With regard to the social
customs of meals at which meat that had been offered in heathen
sacrifices was a part, and of feasts actually at heathen temples,
doubtful questions arose. Was it a denial of the faith to eat
such food or not? Mixed marriages, too, had their problems;
ought the believing wife to separate herself? Ought the believing
husband to insist that his heathen wife stay with him against her
will? And, further, in the case of slaves, does the consciousness
of Christian manhood give a new motive for trying to gain
worldly freedom? In all these matters Paul gives sensible
advice. There were clearly two groups of Christians, the &ldquo;weak,&rdquo;
or scrupulous, whose principle was to abstain, and the &ldquo;strong,&rdquo;
or free, who maintained that the morally insignificant must not
usurp a place to which it has no right. Paul sides with neither,
but follows two principles, one that the church and its members
must be kept pure, the other that the moral welfare not only
of the individual but of his neighbour must be the controlling
motive.</p>

<p>Not due so much to heathen influences as to the natural
tendencies of imperfect and passionate human nature were other
conditions. The most striking incident here, and one which gave
Paul much concern, was the case of a man who after his father&rsquo;s
death had married his own stepmother (&ldquo;the case of incest&rdquo;).
That this was rare in the ancient world and generally abominated
both by Jews and Greeks made it seem to Paul the more imperative
that this stain on the Christian church should be removed.
His language shows his indignation and grief that the Corinthians
themselves have not already taken the matter in hand.</p>

<p>Besides these troubles from heathenism there were questions
of asceticism; the Greek reaction against naturalism held that
nature was vile and marriage wrong. Paul had a qualified
tendency to asceticism, but he shows excellent good sense in
his discussion of these delicate matters.</p>

<p>A different set of difficulties arose from the freedom into which
Christianity had introduced persons from all classes of life.
What degree of freedom was permissible to a Christian woman?
How far must a woman of the lower classes who became a
Christian subject herself to the restrictions of a higher class of
society? Might a woman, as a free child of God, take part in
the Christian public meeting?</p>

<p>Also in matters pertaining to the common religious life of the
new society the new situation raised new problems. How should
reasonable order be maintained in the wholly democratic forms
of the church devotional meeting? What value should be
assigned to the different religious functions or &ldquo;spiritual
gifts&rdquo;? Did any of them confer the right to a consciousness
of God&rsquo;s special favour? Again, the celebration of the
Lord&rsquo;s supper, which was associated with a proper meal, was
marred by exhibitions of selfishness and irreverence that needed
correction.</p>

<p>The great variety of practical problems present to the anxious
minds of the Corinthians themselves and of germinant abuses
revealed to the paternal scrutiny of the apostle, opens to us
some notion of the exciting times in which the Corinthian
Christians stood, and explains the intensity and detailed concern
of the apostle. From every side and at every moment new and
often difficult questions were arising; to every one of them
belonged remoter relations that made it profoundly important.
It is by no accident that Paul is in the habit of treating the
simplest moral issues by reference to the highest principles of
his theology. From the situation at Corinth we gain an idea of
what was taking place in many cities, but in the seething life
of so great a capital with more rapid and varied development.</p>

<p>Of strictly intellectual and theological problems or errors only
one is treated systematically, although at many other points in
the practical discussions we can detect the theoretical basis
cf the errors combated and the theological foundations of Paul&rsquo;s
own judgments. Questions about the resurrection, however,
had appeared, of a rationalistic nature and evincing an Hellenic
failure to understand the Jewish view. In his reply Paul shows
that he too recognizes the significance of the Greek&rsquo;s difficulties
and he presents a conception which, fortunately for the later
Church, does some measure of justice to the superior scientific
insight of their attitude.</p>

<p><i>Second Epistle.</i>&mdash;After the despatch of First Corinthians
there took place, it would appear, the riot in the theatre at
Ephesus (Acts xix. 23 ff.), to which 2 Cor. i. 8 seems to refer.
On leaving Ephesus Paul went to Troas (2 Cor. ii. 12), then to
Macedonia, and from Macedonia (2 Cor. vii. 5, viii. 1, ix. 2)
he wrote Second Corinthians. This must have been in the autumn
of one of the years <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 54-58, nearly or quite a year after
First Corinthians was written (cf, &ldquo;a year ago,&rdquo; 2 Cor. viii. 10,
ix. 2 and 1 Cor. xvi. 1-4). In the meantime there had been
exciting developments in Paul&rsquo;s relations with Corinth, the course
of which we can partly trace by the aid of the second epistle.
These events explain the great difference in tone between the
second epistle and the first.</p>

<p>Several allusions in Second Corinthians show that Paul had
already twice visited Corinth (2 Cor. ii. 1, xii. 14, xii. 21, xiii.
2). The second of these visits is not mentioned in Acts; it is
referred to by Paul as having a painful character. The most
natural hypothesis is that, in consequence of a growing spirit
of insubordination on the part of the Corinthians, Paul found it
necessary to go to Corinth from Ephesus (probably by sea direct)
at some time after First Corinthians was written. Of what
happened on this visit, which the writer of Acts has naturally
enough thought it unnecessary to mention, we seem to learn
further from certain passages in the letter (2 Cor. ii. 5-11, vii. 9)
which refer to some sort of an insult to Paul for which there has
now been repentance and which the apostle heartily forgives.
For the offender he entreats also the pardon of the church. It
may well be that the sad affair had to do with the gross offender
of the &ldquo;case of incest&rdquo; (1 Cor. v. 1-8), who with the support
of his fellow Christians may have refused to conform to Paul&rsquo;s
imperative commands. We may suppose an angry scene,
possibly an attack of Paul&rsquo;s bodily ailment (especially if the
&ldquo;thorn in the flesh&rdquo; be understood to be epilepsy), the immediate
triumph of the adversaries, Paul&rsquo;s speedy departure in grief.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
If, as other scholars hold, the offender was not the same as in
the first epistle, the general picture of the visit will not have to
be much changed.</p>

<p>Besides making this visit it is probable that Paul also wrote
to Corinth a letter, now lost, intended to secure the result of
which the unfortunate visit had failed (ii. 3, 4, 9, vii. 8, 12).
It, is, however, possible that the allusions merely refer to I Cor. v.,
in which case it is not necessary to assume this intermediate
letter. The letter, if there was one, may have been sent by Titus,
whom Paul in any case commissioned to go to Corinth and try
to mend matters. Paul describes his anxiety over this last
resource in touching language (ii. 12, 13). Disappointed that
Titus did not meet him at Troas, he moved on to Macedonia,
and there (vii. 5-9) was rejoiced by the coming of the envoy with
good news of the complete return of the Corinthians to integrity
and loyalty.</p>

<p>Second Corinthians was Paul&rsquo;s response to this friendly
attitude reported by Titus. It went by the hand of Titus, who
was promptly sent back to complete the work he had so well
begun (viii. 6, 16-24). In company with him (viii. 18) was sent
a brother (unnamed) who had already been appointed as the
representative of the churches to accompany Paul in carrying
to Jerusalem the great collection of money now nearly completed.
The greater part of the epistle consists of the outpouring of
Paul&rsquo;s thankful and loving heart (chaps, i.-vii.), together with
directions and exhortations relating to the collection.</p>

<p>But the epistle contains evidence of another and a disagreeable
side to the affairs of the Corinthian church. Especially the last
four chapters, but also references in the earlier chapters, show
that virulent personal opponents of Paul and his work had been
exercising an evil activity. It is not easy to discover the precise
relation of these persons to the parties at Corinth or to the series
of events which have just been sketched, but we can well understand
that their presence and efforts played a large part in the
history. We learn that Jewish Christians (xi. 22) had come to
Corinth, doubtless from Jerusalem, with letters of recommendation
(iii. 1). They urged their own claims as apostles (though
not of the twelve), and set themselves up as superior to Paul
(xi. 5, xii. 11, v. 12, xi. 18). Paul calls them &ldquo;false apostles&rdquo;
(xi. 13-15), and declares that they preach &ldquo;another Jesus,
another Spirit, another Gospel&rdquo; (xi. 4). That in Paul&rsquo;s judgment
his influence with the Corinthian church depended on
overthrowing the power of these disturbers of the peace is plain,
and this accounts for the strenuous, and occasionally violent,
tone of his polemic in chapters x.-xiii. As we compare them
with the Judaizers of Galatia it seems that their polemic was
less on the ground of principles and doctrines, and more a
personal attack. Paul does not much argue, as he does in
Galatians, against the inclination of Gentile Christians to subject
themselves to the Law (yet note the contrast of the old veiled
covenant and the new open revelation, iii. 4-18, esp. iii. 6); he
is engaged in personal defence against charges of carnal motives
(x. 2), perhaps even of embezzlement (xii. 16-18), and also of
fickleness (i. 12-ii. 4). When he ironically calls himself a &ldquo;fool&rdquo;
(xi. 1, 16, 17, 19, 21, xii. 6-11), he is doubtless taking up their
term of abuse, and in many of the hard passages of this most
difficult of all Paul&rsquo;s epistles we may suspect that half-quoted
flings of the enemy glimmer through his retort. From 2 Cor.
x. 7, xi. 22 it may be inferred that these Jewish Christians had
something to do with the &ldquo;Christ-party&rdquo; of which we seem to
hear in the first epistle.</p>

<p>To the tact and firmness of Titus must be ascribed much of
the successful issue of these dealings with the Corinthians. Paul
spent the following winter at Corinth (Acts xx. 2, 3); while there
he wrote the Epistle to the Romans, which in its milder tone
gives clear indication that the day of violent controversy with
Judaizing emissaries like those who came to Galatia had passed.
There was indeed, as might have been expected, trouble from
enemies among the Jews, but Paul escaped the danger, and with
the money for the mother church, the collection of which had
so long lain near his heart, he was able to start for Jerusalem
in the spring of one of the years 55-59 (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paul</a></span>).</p>

<p>In later time (circ. A.D. 95) we hear from the epistle of Clement
of Rome that the Corinthian church paid full honour to Paul&rsquo;s
memory; and circ. A.D. 139, the excellent Catholic (though
Hebrew) Christian Hegesippus found himself deeply refreshed
by the honest life and the fidelity to Christian truth of the descendants
and successors of the Christians over whom Paul had
laboured with such faithful oversight and so many anxious tears.</p>

<p><i>Critical Questions.</i>&mdash;The manuscript evidence for the
Corinthian epistles is the same as for the other epistles of Paul
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bible:</a></span> <i>New Testament</i>). Of early attestation the amount
is rather greater for First Corinthians than for other epistles.
Not only were both epistles included without question in the
Pauline canon of Marcion (circ. A.D. 150) and in the Muratorian
list (end of 2nd century), and known to various Gnostic sects
of the 2nd century, but Clement of Rome (circ. A.D. 95) makes
a specific reference (xlvii. 1) to the fact that the Corinthians
&ldquo;received the Epistle of the blessed Apostle Paul,&rdquo; and proceeds
with an unmistakable quotation from 1 Cor. i. 11-13.
Other quotations from First Corinthians are found in Clement,
Ignatius, Polycarp, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Irenaeus, Clement
of Alexandria, Tertullian, while use of the epistle can probably
be detected in Hermas. Second Corinthians was, and still
remains, less quotable, but it is probably used by Polycarp,
perhaps by Ignatius, and by the presbyters known to Irenaeus,
and it was freely used by Theophilus, Irenaeus, Clement of
Alexandria and Tertullian.</p>

<p>The only serious doubt of the genuineness of First and Second
Corinthians has been that of the so-called Dutch school of critics,
in the latter part of the 19th century, and forms a part of their
attempt (the first since that of Baur) entirely to reconstruct
the history of early Christianity. Their view that the Corinthian
epistles are the product of a body of progressive Christians in
the 2nd century, who ascribed to a legendary Paul the advanced
views they had themselves developed, has not commended
itself to critics, and seems to be burdened by nearly all possible
difficulties. The genuineness of both epistles is, in fact, amply
attested not only by early writers, but by the surer proof of
complicated and consistent concreteness, with perfect adaptation
to all we know of Paul and of the passing circumstances of the
earliest days of Christianity in Greece. For a writer a century
later to have composed the Corinthian epistles and then successfully
passed them off as the work of Paul could be explained
only by an hypothesis of inspiration! It would have been as
difficult as to forge a daily newspaper. It is to be observed that
the two epistles are so intimately connected by their contents
with Romans and Galatians that the four together support one
another&rsquo;s genuineness.</p>

<p>In Second Corinthians two important questions of integrity
have been much discussed. (1) 2 Cor. vi. 14-vii. 1 is a passage
somewhat distinct from its context, and introduced by a seemingly
abrupt break in the sequence of thought. It is, therefore,
held by some (including G. Heinrici) to be an interpolation by
another writer, by others (as A. Hilgenfeld) to be a part of the
letter referred to in 1 Cor. v. 9. But the arguments against
Pauline authorship are not convincing; there is after all a certain
real connexion to be traced between the section and vi. I; and
the resemblance to the substance of 1 Cor. v. 9 is natural in any
case. (2) More important is the question as to 2 Cor. x.-xiii.
Since J. S. Semler (1776) it has been held by careful scholars that
these chapters are written in a tone of excited irritation which
is out of accord with the genial tone of gratified affection and
confidence that pervades chaps, i.-ix. Hence such scholars as
A. Hausrath, R. A. Lipsius, O. Pfleiderer, P. W. Schmiedel, A. C.
M&rsquo;Giffert have adopted the view that these four chapters were
not written as part of Second Corinthians, but, while unquestionably
from Paul&rsquo;s hand, were from a separate letter (the &ldquo;Vier-kapitel-Brief&rdquo;),
probably the same as that supposed to be referred
to in 2 Cor. ii. 3-9, vii. 8-12. This theory is, however, probably
not correct, for while, on the one hand, it is based on an exaggeration
of the differences and a neglect of certain lines of connexion
between the chaps, x.-xiii. and chaps, i.-ix., on the other hand
the identification supposed is made difficult by several facts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
Thus these chapters contain no mention whatever of the offender
of 2 Cor. ii. 5-11, of whose case the intervening letter must have
mainly treated; again, x. 1, 9, 10, 11 imply a previous sharp
rebuke already administered, such as is hardly accounted for
merely by First Corinthians; and finally, xii. 18 implies that
these four chapters were not written until after Titus&rsquo;s visit,
that is, that they were written at just the same time as Second
Corinthians.</p>

<p>An apocryphal correspondence of Paul and the church at
Corinth, consisting of the church&rsquo;s letter and Paul&rsquo;s reply, had
canonical authority in the Syrian church in the 4th century
(Aphraates, Ephraem). It is preserved in Armenian and Latin
manuscripts, and is now known to have been a part of the Acts of
Paul, written in the 2nd century. The letters relate to the condemnation
of certain Gnostic views. For a translation see

<p><span class="bold">CORIOLANUS, GAIUS<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Gnaeus</span>) <span class="bold">MARCIUS,</span> Roman legendary
hero of patrician descent. According to tradition, his surname
was due to the bravery displayed by him at the siege of Corioli
(493 B.C.) during the war against the Volscians (but see below).
In 492, when there was a famine in Rome, he advised that the
people should not be relieved out of the supplies obtained from
Sicily, unless they would consent to the abolition of their tribunes.
For this he was accused by the tribunes, and, being condemned
to exile, took refuge with his friend Attius Tullius, king of the
Volscians. A pretext for a quarrel with Rome was found, and
Coriolanus, in command of the Volscian army, advanced against
his native city. In vain the first men of Rome prayed for
moderate terms. He would agree to nothing less than the
restoration to the Volscians of all their land, and their admission
among the Roman citizens. A mission of the chief priests also
failed. At last, persuaded by his mother Veturia and his wife
Volumnia, he led back the Volscian army, and restored the
conquered towns. He died at an advanced age in exile amongst
the Volscians; according to others, he was put to death by them
as a traitor; a third tradition (mentioned, but ridiculed, by
Cicero) represents him as having taken his own life.</p>

<p>The whole legend is open to serious criticism. At the traditional
date (493 B.C.) Corioli was not a Volscian possession,
but one of the Latin cities which had concluded a treaty of
alliance with Rome; further, Livy himself states that the
chroniclers knew nothing of a campaign carried on by the consul
Postumus Cominius Auruncus (under whom Coriolanus is said
to have served) against the Volscians. Only one of the consuls
was mentioned as having concluded the treaty; the absence of
the other was consequently assumed, and a reason for it found in
a Volscian war. The bestowal of a cognomen from a captured
city was unknown at the time, the first instance being that of
Scipio; in any case, it would have been conferred upon the
commander-in-chief, Postumus Cominius Auruncus, not upon a
subordinate. The conquest of Corioli by Coriolanus is invented
to explain the surname. The details of the famine are borrowed
from those of later years, especially 433 and 411. The incident
of Coriolanus taking refuge with the Volscian king, who, according
to Plutarch, was his bitter enemy, curiously resembles the appeal
of Themistocles to the Molossian king Admetus. Further, the
tradition that Coriolanus, like Themistocles, committed suicide,
renders it a probable conjecture that these incidents are derived
from a Greek source. The contradictions in the accounts of the
campaign against Rome and its inherent improbability give
further ground for suspicion. Twelve important towns are taken
in a single summer apparently without resistance on the part of
the Romans, and after the retirement of Coriolanus they are
immediately abandoned by the conquerors. It is strange that
the Volscians should have entrusted a stranger with the command
of their army, and it is possible that the attribution of their
successes to a Roman general was intended to gratify the national
pride and obliterate the memory of a disastrous war. It is suggested
that Coriolanus never commanded the Volscian army at
all, but that, like Appius Herdonius&mdash;the Sabine chieftain who
in 460, with a band of fugitives and slaves, obtained possession
of the capital&mdash;he appeared at the gates of Rome at the head of
a body of exiles (but at a much later date, c. 443), at a time when
the city was in great distress, perhaps as the result of a pestilence,
and only desisted from making himself master of Rome at the
earnest entreaty of his mother. This seems to be the historical
nucleus of the tradition, which accentuates the great influence
exercised by and the respect shown to the Roman matrons in
early times.</p>

Marcius Coriolanus, its original conqueror, who, in disgust at
his treatment by his countrymen, had deserted to the enemy.
After this it does not appear in history, and we hear soon afterwards
(443 B.C.) of a dispute between Ardea and Aricia about
some land which had been part of the territory of Corioli, but had
at an unknown date passed to Rome with Corioli. The site is apparently
to be sought in the N.W. portion of the district between
the sea, the river Astura and the Alban Hills; but it cannot

<p><span class="bold">CORIPPUS, FLAVIUS CRESCONIUS,<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> Roman epic poet of the
6th century A.D. He was a native of Africa, and in one of the
MSS. is called <i>grammaticus</i> (teacher). He has been identified,
but on insufficient grounds, with Cresconius, an African bishop
(7th century), author of a <i>Concordia Canonum</i>, or collection of
the laws of the church. Nothing is known of Corippus beyond
what is contained in his own poems. He appears to have held
the office of tribune or notary (<i>scriniarius</i>) under Anastasius,
imperial treasurer and chamberlain of Justinian, at the end of
whose reign he left Africa for Constantinople, in consequence
of having lost his property during the Moorish and Vandal wars.
He was the author of two poems, of considerable importance
for the history of the times, one of which was not discovered till
the beginning of the 19th century. The latter poem, dedicated
to the nobles of Carthage, which comes first in point of time,
is called <i>Johannis</i> or <i>De bellis Libycis</i>, and relates the overthrow
of the Moors by a certain Johannes, <i>magister militum</i> in 546; it
is in eight books (the last is unfinished) and contains about
5000 hexameters. The narrative commences with the despatch
of Johannes to the theatre of war by Justinian, and ends with
the decisive victory near Carthage (548). The other poem (<i>In
laudem Justini minoris</i>), in four books, contains the death of
Justinian, the coronation of his successor Justin II. (14th of
November 565), and the early events of his reign. It is preceded
by a preface, and a short and fulsome panegyric on Anastasius,
the poet&rsquo;s patron. The <i>Laus</i> was published at Antwerp in 1581
by Michael Ruyz Azagra, secretary to the emperor Rudolf II.,
from a 9th or 10th century MS. The preface contains a reference
to a previous work by the author on the wars in Africa, and
although Johannes Cuspinianus (1473-1529) in his <i>De Caesaribus
et Imperatoribus</i> professed to have seen a MS. of it in the library
at Buda (destroyed by Suleiman II. in 1527), it was not till 1814
that it was discovered at Milan by Cardinal Mazzucchelli,
librarian of the Ambrosian library, from the codex Trivultianus
(in the library of the marquis Trivulzi), the only MS. of the
<i>Johannis</i> still extant.</p>

<p>The <i>Johannis</i> is of great value, not only from a purely historical
point of view, but also as giving a description of the land and
people of Africa, which conscientiously records the impressions
of an intelligent native observer; many of his statements as
to manners and customs are confirmed both by independent
ancient authorities (such as Procopius) and by our knowledge
of the modern Berbers. Virgil, Lucan, and Claudian were the
poet&rsquo;s chief models. The <i>Laus</i>, which was written when he was
advanced in years, although marred by Byzantine servility and
gross flattery of a by no means worthy object, throws much light
upon Byzantine court ceremony, as in the account of the accession
of Justin and the reception of the embassy of the Avars. On
the whole the language and metre of Corippus, considering the
age in which he lived and the fact that he was not a native
Italian, is remarkably pure. That he was a Christian is rendered
probable by negative indications, such as the absence of all the
usual mythological accessories of an epic poem, positive allusions
to texts of Scripture, and the highly orthodox passage <i>Laus</i> iv.
294 ff.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The editions of the <i>Johannis</i> by P. Mazzucchelli (1820) and of the
<i>Laus</i> by P. F. Foggini (1777) are still valuable for their commentaries.
They are both included in the 28th volume of the Bonn <i>Corpus
scriptorum historiae Byzantinae</i>. The best modern editions are by
J. Partsch (in <i>Monumenta Germaniae historica</i>, 1879), with very
valuable prolegomena, and M. Petschenig (<i>Berliner Studien für

navigation dangerous. The bay encloses many small islands
and islets, some hardly distinguishable from sandbanks and
submerged at high water, giving rise to a native saying that
&ldquo;half the islands live under water.&rdquo; The principal islands
are four, Bana, Great and Little Elobey, and Corisco, the last-named
lying farthest to seaward and giving its name to the
bay.</p>

<p>Corisco Island, the largest of the group, is some 3 m. long by
1¾ m. in breadth and has an area of about 5½ sq. m. The surface
of the island is very diversified. On a miniature scale it possesses
mountains and valleys, rivers, lakes, forests and swamps, grassland
and bushland, moorland and parkland. The forests supply
ebony and logwood for export. The natives are a Bantu-Negro
tribe called Benga. There are among them many converts to
Roman Catholicism and a few Protestants. Corisco and the
other islands named are Spanish possessions and are governed
as dependencies of Fernando Po.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORK, RICHARD BOYLE,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (1566-1643), Irish
statesman, second son of Roger Boyle of Faversham in Kent,
a descendant of an ancient Herefordshire family, and of Joan,
daughter of Robert Naylor of Canterbury, was born at Canterbury
on the 3rd of October 1566, and was educated at the King&rsquo;s
school and at Bennet (Corpus Christi) College, Cambridge,
where he was admitted in 1583. He afterwards studied law at the
Middle Temple and became clerk to Sir Richard Manwood, chief
baron of the exchequer; but finding his position offered little
opportunity for advancement he determined to make a new
start in Ireland. He landed in Dublin on the 23rd of June 1588,
as he relates himself, with £27, 3s. in money, a gold bracelet
worth £10, and a diamond ring, besides some fine wearing
apparel. He began to make his fortune almost immediately.
In 1590 he obtained the appointment of deputy escheator to
John Crofton, the escheator-general, and in 1595 he married
Joan, daughter and co-heiress of William Appsley of Limerick,
who died in 1599, having brought him an estate of £500 a
year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had been the object of the attacks of Sir Henry
Wallop and others, incited, according to his own account, by
envy at his success and increasing prosperity, and was apprehended
on various charges of fraud in his office, being more than
once thrown into prison. He was on the point of leaving for
England to justify himself to the queen, when the rebellion in
Munster in October 1598 again reduced him to poverty and
obliged him to return to London to his chambers at the Temple.
He was, however, almost immediately taken by Essex into his
service, when Sir Henry Wallop again renewed his prosecution,
with the result that Boyle was summoned before the star
chamber. His enemies appear to have failed in substantiating
their accusations, and in the course of the inquiry, at which he
had secured the presence of the queen herself, he was able
to expose several instances of malversation on the part of his
opponent, who was dismissed in consequence from his office of
treasurer, while Boyle himself, who had favourably impressed
the queen, was declared by her as &ldquo;a man fit to be employed by
ourselves&rdquo; and was at once made clerk of the council of Munster.
He brought to Elizabeth the news of the victory near Kingsale
in December 1601, and in October 1602 was again sent over by
Sir George Carew, the president of Munster, on Irish affairs;
and on this occasion, at the instance of Carew, he bought for
£1000 the whole of Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s lands in Cork, Waterford
and Tipperary, consisting of 12,000 acres with immense capabilities
of development. This offered a splendid opportunity
for the exercise of his genius for business and administration.
Manufactures were established, the breeding of cattle and fish
introduced, mines opened, colonists from England encouraged
to come over, the natural resources of the land developed,
bridges, harbours and roads constructed, and towns settled,
order being maintained by 13 castles garrisoned by retainers.</p>

<p>While himself quickly accumulating vast riches, the services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
which Boyle rendered to the government and to the nation at
such a time of disorder and transition were incalculable. He
soon became the most powerful subject in Ireland. On the
25th of July 1603 he married, as his second wife, Catherine,
daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton, secretary of state, and was
knighted. In 1606 he became a privy councillor for Munster
and in 1613 for Ireland. On the 6th of September 1616 he
was raised to the peerage as Lord Boyle, baron of Youghal, and
on the 26th of October 1620 was created earl of Cork and Viscount
Dungarvan. He was appointed on the 26th of October 1629
a lord justice, and on the 9th of November 1631 lord high
treasurer. Though no peer of England, he was &ldquo;by writ called
into the Upper House by His Majesty&rsquo;s great grace,&rdquo; and took
his place as an &ldquo;assistant sitting on the inside of the Woolsack.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_1c" id="FnAnchor_1c" href="#Footnote_1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
The appointment of Wentworth (Lord Strafford), however, as
lord deputy in 1633 put an end to the predominant power and
influence of Cork in Ireland. &ldquo;A most cursed man,&rdquo; he writes
in his diary on Wentworth&rsquo;s arrival, &ldquo;to all Ireland and to me
in particular.&rdquo; In reality these two great men had much in
common, held similar views of administration, and had the same
talents for practical statesmanship. Cork had already carried
out in Munster the policy which Strafford desired to see extended
to the whole of Ireland. But Cork belonged to the &ldquo;spacious
days of great Elizabeth,&rdquo; and for such a man there was no room
within the narrow despotism and intolerance of the government
of Charles. The subjection of the great was part of Strafford&rsquo;s
settled policy, and consequently, instead of seeking his collaboration
in developing the country and in maintaining order, he
studied merely to diminish his influence. He subjected him to
various humiliations. He forced him to remove his wife&rsquo;s tomb
from the choir in St Patrick&rsquo;s at Dublin, and deprived him
arbitrarily of the greater part of the revenues of Youghal, a
portion of the Raleigh estates. &ldquo;No physic,&rdquo; wrote Laud,
delighted, &ldquo;better than a vomit if it be given in time, and therefore
you have taken a very judicious course to administer one so
early to my Lord of Cork. I hope it will do him good....&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_2c" id="FnAnchor_2c" href="#Footnote_2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
Cork, however, refrained from any systematic or retaliatory
resistance, and even simulated an admiration for Strafford&rsquo;s
rule. At the latter&rsquo;s trial he was an important witness, but
took no active part in the prosecution, though he thoroughly
approved of his condemnation and execution. Scarcely had he
returned to Ireland from witnessing his rival&rsquo;s destruction when
the rebellion broke out, but his influence and preparations,
supported by the military prowess of his sons, were sufficient to
offer a successful resistance to the rebels in Munster and to save
the province from ruin. This was his last great service to the
state. He died about the 15th of September 1643, leaving a
large and illustrious family by his second wife.</p>

<p>Four of his seven sons received independent peerages,&mdash;Richard,
created Baron Clifford and earl of Burlington; Lewis,
Viscount Kinalmeaky, killed in 1642 at the battle of Liscarrol;
Roger, baron of Broghill and earl of Orrery; and Francis,
Viscount Shannon. Another son was Robert Boyle (q.v.), the
famous natural philosopher and chemist.</p>

<p>The title passed to the eldest surviving son, <span class="sc">Richard Boyle</span>,
1st earl of Burlington and 2nd earl of Cork (1612-1698), who
matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, and was knighted in
1624. Returning home after travelling abroad he married in
1635 Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Henry, Lord Clifford, later
earl of Cumberland. On the outbreak of the rebellion he supported
his father in Munster, fought at the battle of Liscarrol,
and raised forces for the first war with the Scots. In 1640 he
represented Appleby in the Long Parliament, and in the civil
war he supported zealously the royal cause, being created in
1643 Baron Clifford of Lanesborough in the peerage of England,
in addition to the earldom of Cork which he inherited from his
father the same year. At the Restoration he obtained also the
earldom of Burlington (or Bridlington), and was appointed
lord-lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire, resigning this
office through opposition to the government of James II. He
held the office of lord treasurer of Ireland from 1680 till 1695.
He died on the 15th of January 1698. His two sons having
predeceased him, he was succeeded in his titles by his grandson
Charles, issue of his eldest son Charles, as 2nd earl of Burlington
and 3rd earl of Cork; and on the extinction of the direct male
line in the person of Richard, the 4th earl, in 1753 the earldom
of Cork fell to the younger branch of the Boyle family, in the
person of John, 5th earl of Orrery, he and later earls being &ldquo;of
Cork and Orrery.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Boyle</span>, 5th earl of Cork and Orrery (1707-1762), only
son of the 4th earl of Orrery, was born on the 2nd of January
1707. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and was led
by indifferent health and many untoward accidents to cultivate
in retirement his talents for literature and poetry. His translation
of the <i>Letters of Pliny the Younger</i>, with various notes,
for the use of his eldest son, was published in 1751. He also
published <i>Remarks on the Life and Writings of Jonathan Swift</i>
(1751), in several letters addressed to his second son, and <i>Memoirs
of Robert Carey, earl of Monmouth</i>, from the original manuscript,
with preface and notes. He died on the 16th of November 1762.
His <i>Letters from Italy</i> appeared in 1774, edited, with memoir,
by the Rev. J. Duncombe. The earldom continued in later
years in the Boyle family, being held in 1909 by the 10th earl
(b. 1861). The wife of the 7th earl (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cork and Orrery</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mary, Countess of</a></span>) was a famous figure in society in the early

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORK,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> a county of Ireland in the province of Munster, bounded
S. by the Atlantic Ocean, E. by the counties Waterford and
Tipperary, N. by Limerick, and W. by Kerry. It is the largest
county in Ireland, having an area of 1,849,686 acres, or about
2890 sq. m. The outline is irregular; the coast is for the most
part bold and rocky, and is intersected by the bays of Bantry,
Dunmanus, and Roaring Water. The southern part of the coast
projects several headlands into the Atlantic, and its south-eastern
side is indented by Cork Harbour, and Ballycotton and
Youghal Bays. The surface is undulating. It consists of low
rounded ridges, with corresponding valleys, running east and
west, except in the western portion of the county, which is more
mountainous. The principal rivers are the Blackwater, the Lee,
and the Bandon, flowing generally eastward from their sources
in the high ground of the west. The most elevated part of the
county is in the Boggeragh Mountains, in the north-west, which
reach an extreme height of 2118 ft. To the south are the Shehy
Mountains, at the root of the two promontories flanking Bantry
Bay, the Caha Mountains forming the backbone of the northern
of these promontories, and the hills of the district of Corbery
to the south of the Shehy range. North of the Blackwater the
country is comparatively level, being a branch of the great plain
which occupies a large part of the centre of Ireland. Of the
principal rivers the Blackwater has its source in the county
Limerick. The Lee originates in the wild and picturesque
Gouganebarra Lough, and the Bandon river rises in the Cullinagh
Lough. There are also some smaller streams which flow directly
into the sea, the more important of these being in the south-west
portion of the county. No lakes of any magnitude occur, the
largest being Lough Allua, or Inchigeelagh, an expansion of the
river Lee. The scenery of the western parts of the county is
bold and rugged. In the central and eastern parts, especially
in the valleys, it is green and quiet, and in some spots well
wooded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The county presents a remarkable simplicity of geological
structure. Its surface is controlled throughout by the
&ldquo;Hercynian&rdquo; folds, running from the Kerry border eastward to the
sea at Youghal. The Old Red Sandstone comes out in the north,
forming the heather-clad Ballyhoura Hills, which are repeated across
the limestone hollow of Mitchelstown by the western spur of the
Knockmealdown Mountains. On the west, beds as high as the
Millstone Grit and Coal Measures remain above the limestone,
extending from Mallow and Kanturk to the Limerick and Kerry
borders. Another synclinal of Carboniferous Limestone runs from
Millstreet through Lismore, and the Blackwater has worn out an easy
course along it. Then the Old Red Sandstone again rises as an
undulating upland through the centre of the county, with a few
synclinal patches of Carboniferous Shale and Limestone caught in
on its back. Cork city lies on the north slope and in the floor of a
larger synclinal, and the Yellow Sandstone, which forms the passage-beds
from the Old Red Sandstone to the Carboniferous, appears near
the city. This hollow continues across the Lee through Middleton.
The limestone in it has become crystalline, veined and brecciated,
while a fine red staining, especially at Little Island, adds to its value
as a marble. After another anticlinal of Old Red Sandstone, the
Carboniferous Slate occupies most of the country southward, with
occasional appearances of the basal Coomhola Grits and of the underlying
Old Red Sandstone along anticlinals. The soils thus vary from
sandy loams, usually on the higher ground, to stiff clays along the
limestone hollows.</p>

<p>This country admirably illustrates the system of river-development
originally traced out by Prof. J. B. Jukes in 1862, and further
explained by Prof. W. M. Davis and others. The folded series,
culminating originally in Upper Carboniferous strata, was worn down,
perhaps as far back as Permian times, until it possessed a fairly
uniform surface. This surface, or &ldquo;peneplain,&rdquo; was probably the
result of denudation working away the beds almost to sea-level.
A subsequent elevation enabled the streams, as in so many cases
now recognized, to cut into the surface along the direction of greatest
inclination, which here happened to be southward. When the higher
strata had been worn away, the rivers and their tributaries worked
upon rocks of very various hardness, but with a common strike from
east to west. The tributaries, running along the strike, speedily
confined themselves to the synclinals of limestone, along which they
could erode and dissolve long valleys. The present surface of anticlinal
sandstone ridges and synclinal limestone hollows thus began
to arise; but the main streams still held on their courses across the
strike, that is, from north to south. Here and there a more active
tributary worked its way back at its head into the basin of one of the
cross-streams, and drew off into its own system the head-waters of
this other stream. With this new flood of water the strengthened
system still further deepened its original ravine across the strike,
while the beheaded cross-stream or streams rapidly dwindled in
importance. Ultimately, the tributaries of the surviving river-systems
appeared as the most important feature, stretching far west&mdash;in
the case of county Cork&mdash;along the synclinal hollows; while
the original cross-ravine remained in the course of each river, a right-angled
bend occurring thus in the lower portion of the valleys.
Jukes urged that the upper part of the original cross-ravine can be
traced above the bend in each case, though the stream now descending
along it seems merely a tributary entering parallel with the
north-and-south portion of the main stream. Moreover, the tributaries
on the north side of the great synclinal valleys may in many
cases be the relics of original cross-streams that once flowed directly
to the sea until captured by the growth along the synclinal of the
tributary of another stream. The Blackwater, rising on Upper
Carboniferous beds on the Kerry border, thus falls steeply southward
to Rathmore, and then turns eastward along the synclinal valley
of limestone from Millstreet to Cappoquin. Here it abruptly turns
south, keeping, in fact, to that part of its valley which was first
developed. The Lee, rising in the Old Red Sandstone moors of
Gouganebarra, runs east, encountering one or two patches of limestone
in the floor of the synclinal on its way, mere residues of the
rock that once occupied the hollow. Near Cork, the limestone and
accompanying shale are better preserved; but the river, instead
of continuing along the synclinal through Middleton to Youghal,
turns south, and forms the now submerged valley of Cork Harbour.
Observations have shown that the coast lay much at its present level
in pre-Glacial times, and that Cork Harbour was thus a marine inlet
before the ice descended into it. The synclinal valleys of Bantry
Bay and Dunmanus Bay were also, in all probability, submerged
at this same early epoch.</p>

<p>The county has been famous for its copper-mines, notably at
Allihies in the extreme west. The region south-west of Bantry
has been mined in several places. Both gold and silver have been
found in the copper-ores of this latter area. Barytes has been mined
near Bantry, Schull and Clonakilty, and manganese-ore at Glandore.
Anthracite has been raised from time to time in the band of Coal
Measures south-west of Kanturk. The marble of Little Island near
Cork is quarried under the name of &ldquo;Cork Red,&rdquo; and the veined
pink and grey marble of Middleton is also much esteemed.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Climate and Watering-places.</i>&mdash;The climate is moist and warm,
the prevailing winds being from the west and south-west. The
annual rainfall in the city of Cork is about 40 in., that of the
whole county being somewhat higher. The mean annual
temperature is about 52° F. The snow-fall during the winter is
usually slight, and snow rarely remains long on the ground except
in sheltered places. The thermal spring of Mallow was formerly
in considerable repute; it is situated in a basin on the banks
of the Blackwater, rising from the base of a limestone hill. The
chief places for sea-bathing are Blackrock, Passage, Monkstown,
Queenstown, and other waterside villages in the vicinity of Cork;
Bantry, Baltimore, Kinsale, Glengarrif and Youghal are also
much frequented during the summer months.</p>

<p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;The soils of the county exhibit no great variety.
They may be reduced in number to four: the calcareous in the
limestone districts; the deep mellow loams found in districts
remote from limestone, and generally occurring in the less
elevated parts of the grey and red sandstone districts; the light
shallow soils, and the moorland or peat soils, the usual substratum
of which is coarse retentive clay. About one-sixth of the total
area is quite barren. In a district of such extent and variety of
surface, the state of agriculture must be liable to much variation.
The more populous parts near the sea, and in the vicinity of the
great lines of communication, exhibit favourable instances of
agricultural improvement. Oats, potatoes and turnips are the
principal crops, but the extent of land under tillage shows a
general decrease. Pasture land, however, extends, and the
number of cattle, sheep and poultry rises; for dairies are
numerous and the character of the Cork butter and farmyard
produce stands high in English and foreign markets.</p>

<p>Youghal, Kinsale, Queenstown, Castletown and Bearhaven
are the deep-sea and coast fishing district centres of the county;
while the salmon fishing is distributed among the districts of
Cork, Bandon, Skibbereen and Bantry. The mackerel fishery
is especially productive from mid-March to mid-June. The
Blackwater, Lee and Bandon, apart from the netting industry,
afford good rod-fishing for salmon, especially the first, on which
Lismore, Fermoy and Mallow are the principal centres. The
loughs, the upper waters of these rivers and their tributaries,
frequently abound in trout. Macroom, Inchigeelagh, Bandon,
Dunmanway and Glandore, with Bantry and Skibbereen, are
all good stations.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The main line of the Great Southern &amp;
Western railway, entering the county from the north at Charleville,
serves Cork and Queenstown. The Cork, Bandon &amp;
South Coast line runs west to Skibbereen, Baltimore, Bantry,
Clonakilty and Kinsale; and there are also the Cork &amp;
Macroom line to Macroom; the Cork, Blackrock &amp; Passage
to the western waterside villages of Cork Harbour, and the
Great Southern &amp; Western branch eastward from Cork to
Youghal; while from Mallow a branch of the same system
continues towards Killarney and the south-western coast of
Ireland. There is also connexion from this junction with Fermoy,
Mitchelstown and county Waterford eastward. The Timoleague
and Courtmacsherry line connects these villages with the Clonakilty
branch of the Cork, Bandon &amp; South Coast Railway.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population (438,432 in 1891; 404,611 in
1901) exhibits a decrease among the most serious of the Irish
counties, and emigration is correspondingly heavy. Of the total
about 90% are Roman Catholics, and about 70% constitute
the rural population. The principal towns are Cork (pop. 76,122,
a county of a city); Queenstown (7909), Fermoy (6126);
Kinsale (4250), Bandon (2830), Youghal (5393), Mallow (4542),
Skibbereen (3208), Macroom (3016), Bantry (3109), Middleton
(3361), Clonakilty (3098), and among smaller towns Charleville,
Mitchelstown, Passage West, Doneraile and Kanturk. Crookhaven
in the extreme S.W. is of importance as a harbour of
refuge, but the chief ports are Cork and Queenstown. The county
is divided into east and west ridings, and contains twenty-three
baronies and 249 parishes. Assizes are held at Cork, and quarter-sessions
at Cork, Fermoy, Kanturk, Kinsale, Mallow, Middleton,
and Youghal in the east riding; and Bandon, Bantry, Clonakilty,
Macroom and Skibbereen in the west riding. The county is in
the Protestant diocese of Cork, and the Roman Catholic diocese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
of Cork, Cloyne, Kerry and Ross. There are seven parliamentary
divisions, east, mid, north, north-east, south, south-east and
west, each returning one member.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Cork is one of the counties which is generally
considered to have been instituted by King John. It had not
always its present extent, for its existing boundaries include
part of the ancient territory of Desmond (q.v.), which, in the
later half of the 16th century, ranked as a separate county.
In 1598, however, there were two sheriffs in the county Cork,
one especially for Desmond, which was then included in Cork,
but was afterwards amalgamated with the county Kerry. In
the same period wide lands in the county were given to settlers
under the crown, and among these were Sir Walter Raleigh
and Edmund Spenser the poet, who received 40,000 acres and
3028 acres respectively. In 1602 a large portion of the estates
of Sir Walter Raleigh and Fane Beecher were purchased by
Richard Boyle, 1st earl of Cork, who had them colonized with
English settlers; and by founding or rebuilding the towns of
Bandon, Clonakilty, Baltimore, Youghal, and afterwards those
of Middleton, Castlemartyr, Charleville and Doneraile, which
were incorporated and made parliamentary boroughs, the family
of Boyle became possessed of nearly the entire political power
of the county.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;The earlier antiquities of the county are rude
monuments of the Pagan era. There are two so-called druids&rsquo;
altars, the most perfect near Cloyne, and certain pillar stones
scattered through the county, with straight marks cut on the
edges called Ogham inscriptions, the interpretation of which is
a subject of much controversy. The remains of the old ecclesiastical
buildings are in a very ruinous condition, being used as
burial-places by the country people. The principal is Kilcrea,
founded by Cormac M&rsquo;Carthy about 1485, some of the tombs
of whose descendants are still in the chancel; the steeple is still
nearly perfect, and chapter-house, cloister, dormitory and
kitchen can be seen. Timoleague church, situated on a romantic
spot on rising ground at the extreme end of Courtmacsherry
Bay, contains some tombs of interest, and is still in fair condition.
Buttevant Abbey (13th century) contains some tombs of the
Barrys and other distinguished families. There is a good crypt
here. All these were the property of the Franciscans. There
are two round towers in the county, one in a fine state of
preservation opposite Cloyne Cathedral, the other at Kinneigh.
On the chapter seal at Ross, which is dated 1661, and seems to
have been a copy of a much earlier one, there is a good example
of a round tower and stone-roofed church, with St Fachnan, to
whom the church is dedicated, standing by, with a book in one
hand and a cross in the other. The present church dates from
1837, but is on the site of a former cathedral united to Cork in
1583. Of Mourne Abbey, near Mallow, once a preceptory of the
Knights Templars, and Tracton Abbey, which once sent a prior
to parliament, the very ruins have perished. On an island of
Lough Gouganebarra are remains of an oratory of St Finbar.</p>

<p>Of the castles, Lohort, built in the reign of King John, is by far
the oldest, and in its architectural features the most interesting;
it is still quite perfect and kept in excellent repair by the owner,
the Earl of Egmont. Blarney Castle, built by Cormac M&lsquo;Carthy
about 1449, has a wide reputation (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Blarney</a></span>). Castles
Mahon and Macroom have been incorporated into the residences
of the earls of Bandon and Bantry. The walls of Mallow Castle
attest its former strength and extent, as also the castle of
Kilbolane. The castles of Buttevant, Kilcrea and Dripsy are
still in good condition. At Kanturk is a huge Elizabethan castle
still known as &ldquo;M&lsquo;Donagh&rsquo;s Folly,&rdquo; left unfinished owing to
objections raised by a jealous government. At Kilcolman castle
near Doneraile the &ldquo;Faerie Queene&rdquo; was written by Spenser.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORK,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> a city, county of a city, parliamentary and municipal
borough and seaport of Co. Cork, Ireland, at the head of the
magnificent inlet of Cork Harbour, on the river Lee, 165½ m.
S.W. of Dublin by the Great Southern &amp; Western railway. Pop.
(1901) 76,122. Until the middle of the 19th century it ranked
second only to Dublin, but is now surpassed by Belfast in
commercial importance. It is the centre of a considerable
railway system, including the Great Southern &amp; Western, the
Cork, Bandon &amp; South Coast, the Cork &amp; Macroom Direct,
the Cork, Blackrock &amp; Passage railways, and the Cork &amp; Muskerry
light railway; each of which companies possesses a separate
station in the city. The passenger steamers to Great Britain,
mainly under the control of the City of Cork Steam Packet
Company, serve Fishguard, Glasgow, Liverpool, Plymouth and
Southampton, London and other ports, starting from Penrose
Quay on the North Channel.</p>

<p>The nucleus of the city occupies an island formed by the North
and South Channels, two arms of the river Lee, and in former
times no doubt merited its name, which signifies a swamp. In
the beginning of the 18th century, indeed, this island was broken
up into many parts connected by drawbridges, by numerous
small channels navigable at high tide. It now includes most
of the principal thoroughfares, which form a notable contrast
to many of the smaller streets and alleys, in which good building
and cleanliness are lacking. Three bridges cross the North
Channel, a footbridge, North Gate bridge and St Patrick&rsquo;s bridge,
the last a handsome three-arch structure leading to St Patrick&rsquo;s
Street, a wide and pleasant thoroughfare, containing a statue
of Father Mathew, the celebrated Capuchin advocate of
temperance, born in 1790. It communicates with the Grand
Parade and this in turn with Great George&rsquo;s Street, to the west,
and the South Mall to the east, the last containing the principal
banks, the County Club house, and good commercial buildings.
The Clarks, South Gate, Parliament and Parnell bridges cross
the South Channel to the southern parts of the city. Public
grounds are few, but on the outskirts of the city are a park and
race-course, with the fashionable Marina promenade; while the
Mardyke walk, on the west of the island, is pleasantly shaded
by a fine avenue, and was the site of the International exhibition
held in 1902. Electric tramways connect the city and suburbs
and traverse the principal streets and the St Patrick&rsquo;s and
Parnell bridges. Both branches of the Lee are lined with fine
quays of cut limestone, extending in total length over 4 m.</p>

<p>The principal church is the Protestant cathedral, founded
in 1865, and consecrated on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day 1870; while the
central tower was completed in 1879. It is dedicated to St Fin
Barre or Finbar, who founded the original cathedral in the
7th century. The present building is in the south-west part
of the city, and replaces a somewhat mean structure erected in
1735 on the site of the ancient cathedral, which suffered during
the siege of Cork in September 1689. Money for the erection of
the building of 1735 was raised by the curious method of a tax
on imported coal. The new cathedral is in the Early French
(pointed) style, with an eastern apse and a striking west front.
Its design was by William Burges (d. 1881), and its erection was
due to the indefatigable exertions and munificence of Dr John
Gregg, bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross; while the tower and
spires were the gift of two merchants of Cork. The other
principal Protestant churches are St Luke&rsquo;s, St Nicholas and
St Anne Shandon, with its striking tower of parti-coloured stones;
and its peal of bells extolled in Father Prout&rsquo;s lyric &ldquo;The Bells
of Shandon.&rdquo; The Roman Catholic cathedral, also dedicated
to St Finbar, is conspicuous on the north side of the city; it
dates from 1808, but has been since restored. Other fine churches
of this faith are St Mary, St Peter and Paul, St Patrick, Holy
Trinity and St Vincent de Paul. St Finbar&rsquo;s cemetery has
handsome monuments, and St Joseph&rsquo;s, founded by Father
Mathew in 1830 on the site of the old botanic gardens of the
Cork Institution, is beautifully planted. The court house in
Great George&rsquo;s Street has a good Corinthian portico, happily
undamaged in a fire which destroyed the rest of the building
in 1891. The custom-house commands the river in a fine position
at the lower junction of the branches. The usual commercial
and public buildings are mainly on the island. The most notable
educational establishment is the University College, founded as
Queen&rsquo;s College (1849), with those of the same name at Belfast
and Galway, under an Act of 1845. A new charter was granted
to it under letters patent pursuant to the Irish Universities
Act 1908, when it was given its present name. The building,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
designed by Sir Thomas Deane, occupies a beautiful site on the
river in the west of the city, where Gill Abbey, of the 7th century,
formerly stood. It is a fine building in Tudor Style, &ldquo;worthy,&rdquo;
said Macaulay, &ldquo;to stand in the High Street of Oxford.&rdquo; A
large library, museum and well-furnished laboratory are here.
The Crawford School of Science (1885); and the Munster Dairy
and Agricultural School, 1 m. west of the city, also claim
notice, while besides parochial and industrial schools several
of the religious orders located here devote themselves to education.
The Cork library (founded 1790) contains a valuable collection
of books. The Royal Cork Institution (1807), in addition to an
extensive library and a rare collection of Oriental MSS., possesses
a valuable collection of minerals, and the collections of casts
from the antique presented by the pope to George IV. There
are numerous literary and scientific societies, including the Cork
Cuvierian and Archaeological Society. The principal clubs are
the County and the Southern in South Mall, and the City in
Grand Parade; while for sport there are the Cork Golf Club,
Little Island, three rowing clubs, and the Royal Munster and
Royal Cork Yacht clubs, the latter located at Queenstown. The
theatres are the opera-house in Nelson&rsquo;s Place, and the Theatre
Royal.</p>

<p>The country neighbouring to Cork is highly attractive. The
harbour, with the ceaseless activity of shipping, its calm waters,
sheltered by many islands, and its well-wooded shores studded
with pleasant watering-places, affords a series of charming views,
apart from its claim to be considered one of the finest natural
harbours in the kingdom. Military depots occupy several of
the smaller islets, and three batteries guard the entry. This
is about 1 m. wide, but within the width increases to 3 m. while
the length is about 10 m. The Atlantic port of Queenstown
(q.v.) is on Great Island at the head of the outer harbour. Tivoli
(the residence of Sir Walter Raleigh), Fort William, Lota Park,
and Blackrock Castle are notable features on the shore; and
Passage, Blackrock, Glenbrook and Monkstown are waterside
resorts. Inland from Cork runs the picturesque valley of the
Lee, and low hills surround the commanding situation of the
port.</p>

<p>The harbour is by far the most important on the south coast
of Ireland, and dredging operations render the quays approachable
for vessels drawing 20 ft. at all states of the tide. Its trade
is mainly with Bristol and the ports of South Wales. The imports,
exceeding £1,000,000 in annual value, include large quantities
of wheat and maize, while the exports (about £9000 annually)
are chiefly of cattle, provisions, butter and fish. The Cork
Butter Exchange, where classification of the various qualities
is carried out by branding under the inspection of experts, was
important in the early part of the 17th century, and an unbroken
series of accounts dates from 1769 when the present market was
founded. There are distilleries, breweries, tanneries and iron
foundries in the city; and manufactures of woollen and leather
goods, tweeds, friezes, gloves and chemical manure. Nearly
six-sevenths of the population are Roman Catholics. The city
does not share with the county the rapid decrease of population.
It is governed by a lord mayor, 14 aldermen and 42 councillors.
The parliamentary borough returns two members.</p>

<p>The original site of Cork seems to have been in the vicinity
of the Protestant cathedral; St Finbar&rsquo;s ecclesiastical foundation
attracting many students and votaries. In the 9th century the
town was frequently pillaged by the Northmen. According to
the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i> a fleet burned Cork in 821, in
846 the Danes appear to have been in possession of the town,
for a force was collected to demolish their fortress; and in 1012
Cork again fell in flames. The Danes then appear to have founded
the new city on the banks of the Lee as a trading centre. It was
anciently surrounded with a wall, an order for the reparation
of which is found so late as 1748 in the city council books (which
date from 1610). Submission and homage were made to Henry
II. on his arrival in 1172, and subsequently the English held
the town for a long period against the Irish, by constant and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
careful watch. Cork showed favour to Perkin Warbeck in 1492,
and its mayor was hanged in consequence. In 1649 it surrendered
to Cromwell, and in 1689 to the earl of Marlborough after five
days&rsquo; siege, when Henry, duke of Grafton, was mortally wounded.
Cork was a borough by prescription, and successive charters
were granted to it from the reign of Henry II. onward. By a
charter of Edward IV. the lord mayor of Cork was created admiral
of the port, and this office is manifested in a triennial ceremony
in which the mayor throws a dart over the harbour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORK<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (perhaps through Sp. <i>corcha</i> from Lat. <i>cortex</i>, bark,
but possibly connected with <i>quercus</i>, oak), the outer layer of
the bark of an evergreen species of oak (<i>Quercus Suber</i>). The
tree reaches the height of about 30 ft., growing in the south of
Europe and on the North African coasts generally; but it is
principally cultivated in Spain and Portugal. The outer layer
of bark in the cork oak by annual additions from within gradually
becomes a thick soft homogeneous mass, possessing those compressible
and elastic properties upon which the economic value
of the material chiefly depends. The first stripping of cork from
young trees takes place when they are from fifteen to twenty
years of age. The yield, which is rough, unequal and woody in
texture, is called virgin cork, and is useful only as a tanning
substance, or for forming rustic work in ferneries, conservatories,
&amp;c. Subsequently the bark is removed every eight or ten years,
the quality of the cork improving with each successive stripping;
and the trees continue to live and thrive under the operation for
150 years and upwards. The produce of the second barking is
still so coarse in texture that it is only fit for making floats for
nets and for similar applications. The operation of stripping
the trees takes place during the months of July and August.
Two cuts are made round the stem&mdash;one a little above the
ground, and the other immediately under the spring of the main
branches. Between these three or four longitudinal incisions are
then made, the utmost care being taken not to injure the inner
bark. The cork is thereafter removed in the sections into which
it has been cut, by inserting under it the wedge-shaped handle
of the implement used in making the incisions. After the outer
surface has been scraped and cleaned, the pieces are flattened
by heating them over a fire and submitting them to pressure on
a flat surface. In the heating operation the surface is charred,
and thereby the pores are closed up, and what is termed &ldquo;nerve&rdquo;
is given to the material. In this state the cork is ready for
manufacture or exportation.</p>

<p>Though specially developed in the cork-oak, the substance
cork is an almost universal product in the stems (and roots) of
woody plants which increase in diameter year by year. Generally
towards the end of the first year the original thin protective
layer of a stem or branch is replaced by a thin layer of &ldquo;cork,&rdquo;
that is a layer of cells the living contents of which have disappeared
while the walls have become thickened and toughened
as the result of the formation in them of a substance known as
suberin. Fresh cork is formed each season by an active formative
layer below the layer developed last season, which generally
peels off. Where the formation is extensive and persistent as
in the cork-oak, a thick covering of cork is formed. In some
cases, as on young shoots of the cork-elm, the development
is irregular and wing-like outgrowths of cork are formed. In
northern Russia a similar method to that used for obtaining
cork from the cork-oak is employed with the birch.</p>

<p>Cork possesses a combination of properties which peculiarly
fits it for many and diverse uses, for some of which it alone is
found applicable. The leading purpose for which it is used is
for forming bungs and stoppers for bottles and other vessels
containing liquids. Its compressibility, elasticity and practical
imperviousness to both air and water so fit it for this purpose
that the term cork is even more applied to the function than to
the substance. Its specific lightness, combined with strength
and durability, recommend it above all other substances for
forming life-buoys, belts and jackets, and in the construction
of life-boats and other apparatus for saving from drowning.
On account of its lightness, softness and non-conducting properties
it is used for hat-linings and the soles of shoes, the latter
being a very ancient application of cork. It is also used in
making artificial limbs, for lining entomological cases, for
pommels in leather-dressing, and as a medium for making
architectural models. Chips and cuttings are ground up and
mixed with india-rubber to form kamptulicon floor-cloth,
or &ldquo;cork-carpet.&rdquo; The inner bark of the cork-tree is a valuable
tanning material.</p>

<p>Certain of the properties and uses of cork were known to the
ancient Greeks and Romans, and the latter, we find by Horace
(<i>Odes</i> iii. 8), used it as a stopper for wine-vessels:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;corticem adstrictum pice dimovebit</p>
<p class="i05">amphorae&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>It appears, however, that cork was not generally used for
stopping bottles till so recent a period as near the end of the
17th century, and bottles themselves were not employed for
storing liquids till the 15th century. Many substitutes have
been proposed for cork as a stoppering agent; but except in the
case of aerated liquids none of these has recommended itself
in practice. For aerated water bottles several successful devices
have been introduced. The most simple of these is an india-rubber
ball pressed upwards into the narrow of the bottle neck
by the force of the gas contained in the water; and in another
system a glass ball is similarly pressed against an india-rubber
collar inserted in the neck of the bottle. By analogy the term
&ldquo;to cork&rdquo; is used of any such devices for sealing up a bottle or
aperture.</p>

(1746-1840), was born on the 21st of May 1746, the daughter
of the first Viscount Galway. From her early years she took a
keen interest in literature, and through her influence her mother&rsquo;s
house in London became a favourite meeting-place of literary
celebrities. Dr Johnson was a frequent guest. According to
Boswell, Miss Monckton&rsquo;s &ldquo;vivacity enchanted the sage, and
they used to talk together with all imaginable ease.&rdquo; Sheridan,
Reynolds, Burke and Horace Walpole were among her constant
visitors, and Mrs Siddons was her closest friend. In 1786 she
married the seventh earl of Cork and Orrery, who died in 1798.
As Lady Cork, her love of social &ldquo;lions&rdquo; became more pronounced
than ever. Among her regular guests were Canning
and Castlereagh, Byron, Sir Walter Scott, Lord John Russell,
Sir Robert Peel, Theodore Hook and Sydney Smith. She is
supposed to have been the original of Lady Bellair in Disraeli&rsquo;s
<i>Henrietta Temple</i>, and Dickens is believed to have drawn on her
for some of the peculiarities of Mrs Leo Hunter in <i>Pickwick</i>.
Lady Cork had a remarkable memory, and was a brilliant conversationalist.
She died in London on the 30th of May 1840.
She was then ninety-four, but within a few days of her death
had been either dining out or entertaining every night. There
is a fine portrait of her by Reynolds.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORMENIN, LOUIS MARIE DE LA HAYE,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> <span class="sc">Vicomte de</span>
(1788-1868), French jurist and political pamphleteer, was born
at Paris on the 6th of January 1788. His father and his grandfather
both held the rank of lieutenant-general of the admiralty.
At the age of twenty he was received advocate, and about the
same time he gained some reputation as a writer of piquant
and delicate poems. In 1810 he received from Napoleon I. the
appointment of auditor to the council of state; and after the
restoration of the Bourbons he became master of requests.
During the period of his connexion with the council he devoted
himself zealously to the study of administrative law. He was
selected to prepare some of the most important reports of the
council. Among his separate publications at this time are noted,&mdash;<i>Du
conseil d&rsquo;état envisagé comme conseil et comme juridiction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
dans notre monarchie constitutionnelle</i> (1818), and <i>De la responsabilité
des agents du gouvernement</i>. In the former he claimed, for
the protection of the rights of private persons in the administration
of justice, the institution of a special court whose members
should be irremovable, the right of oral defence, and publicity
of trial. In 1822 appeared his <i>Questions de droit administratif</i>,
in which he for the first time brought together and gave scientific
shape to the scattered elements of administrative law. These he
arranged and stated clearly in the form of aphorisms, with logical
deductions, establishing them by proofs drawn from the archives
of the council of state. This is recognized as his most important
work as a jurist. The fifth edition (1840) was thoroughly
revised.</p>

<p>In 1828 Cormenin entered the Chamber of Deputies as member
for Orleans, took his seat in the Left Centre, and began a vigorous
opposition to the government of Charles X. As he was not
gifted with the qualifications of the orator, he seldom appeared
at the tribune; but in the various committees he defended all
forms of popular liberties, and at the same time delivered, in a
series of powerful pamphlets, under the pseudonym of &ldquo;Timon,&rdquo;
the most formidable blows against tyranny and all political
and administrative abuses. After the revolution of July 1830,
Cormenin was one of the 221 who signed the protest against the
elevation of the Orleans dynasty to the throne; and he resigned
both his office in the council of state and his seat in the chamber.
He was, however, soon re-elected deputy, and now voted with
the extreme Left. The discussions on the budget in 1831 gave
rise to the publication of his famous series of <i>Lettres sur la liste
civile</i>, which in ten years ran through twenty-five editions. In
the following year he was elected deputy for Belley. In 1834 he
was elected by two arrondissements, and sat for Joigny, which
he represented till 1846. In this year he lost his seat in consequence
of the popular prejudice aroused against him by his
trenchant pamphlet <i>Oui et non</i> (1845) against attacks on religious
liberty, and a second entitled <i>Feu! Feu!</i> (1845), written in
reply to those who demanded a retractation of the former.
Sixty thousand copies were rapidly sold.</p>

<p>Cormenin was an earnest advocate of universal suffrage before
the revolution of February 1848, and had remorselessly exposed
the corrupt practices at elections in his pamphlet&mdash;<i>Ordre du jour
sur la corruption électorale</i>. After the revolution he was elected
by four departments to the Constituent Assembly, and became
one of its vice-presidents. He was also member and president
of the constitutional commission, and for some time took a leading
part in drawing up the republican constitution. But the disputes
which broke out among the members led him to resign the
presidency. He was soon after named member of the council
of state and president of the <i>comité du contentieux</i>. It was at
this period that he published two pamphlets&mdash;<i>Sur l&rsquo;indépendance
de l&rsquo;Italie</i>. After the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of December 2, 1851, Cormenin,
who had undertaken the defence of Prince Louis Napoleon after
his attempt at Strassburg, accepted a place in the new council
of state of the empire. Four years later, by imperial ordinance,
he was made a member of the Institute. One of the most
characteristic works of Cormenin is the <i>Livre des orateurs</i>, a
series of brilliant studies of the principal parliamentary orators
of the restoration and the monarchy of July, the first edition
of which appeared in 1838, and the eighteenth in 1860. In 1846
he published his <i>Entretiens de village</i>, which procured him the
Montyon prize, and of which six editions were called for the
same year. His last work was <i>Le Droit de tonnage en Algérie</i>
(1860). He died at Paris, on the 6th of May 1868. Two volumes
of his <i>Reliquiae</i> were printed in Paris in the same year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORMON, FERNAND<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (1845-&emsp;&emsp;), French painter, was born
in Paris. He became a pupil of Cabanel, Fromentin and Portaels,
and one of the leading historical painters of modern France.
At an early age he attracted attention by the better class of
sensationalism in his art, although for a time his powerful brush
dwelled with particular delight on scenes of bloodshed, such as
the &ldquo;Murder in the Seraglio&rdquo; (1868) and the &ldquo;Death of Ravara,
Queen of Lanka&rdquo; at the Toulouse Museum. The Luxembourg
has his &ldquo;Cain flying before Jehovah&rsquo;s Curse&rdquo;; and for the
Mairie of the fourth arrondissement of Paris he executed in
grisaille a series of Panels: &ldquo;Birth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Death,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marriage,&rdquo;
&ldquo;War,&rdquo; &amp;c. &ldquo;A Chief&rsquo;s Funeral,&rdquo; and pictures having the
Stone Age for their subject, occupied him for several years.
He was appointed to the Legion of Honour in 1880. Subsequently
he also devoted himself to portraiture.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORMONTAINGNE, LOUIS DE<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (c. 1697-1752), French military
engineer, was born at Strassburg. He was present as a volunteer
at the sieges of Freiburg and Landau in the later years of the
War of the Spanish Succession, and in 1715 he entered the
engineers. After being stationed for some years at Strassburg
he became captain, and was put in charge (at first in a subordinate
capacity, and subsequently as chief engineer) of the
new works, Forts Moselle and Bellecroix, at Metz, which he
built according to his own system of fortification. He was present
at the siege of Philipsburg in 1733, and as a lieutenant-colonel
took part in most of the sieges in the Low Countries during the
War of the Austrian Succession. He attained the rank of
brigadier and finally that of <i>maréchal de camp</i>, and was employed
in fortification work until his death. His <i>Architecture militaire</i>,
written in 1714, was long kept secret by order of the authorities,
but, an unauthorized edition having appeared at the Hague
in 1741, he himself prepared another version called <i>Premier
mémoire sur la fortification</i>, which from 1741 onwards was followed
by others. His ideas are closely modelled on those of Vauban
(q.v.), and in his lifetime he was not considered the equal of such
engineers as d&rsquo;Asfeld and Filley. It was not until twenty years
after his death that his system became widely known. Fourcroy
de Rainecourt, then chief of engineers, searching the archives
for valuable matter, chose the numerous memoirs of Cormontaingne
for publication amongst engineer officers in 1776. Even
then they only circulated privately, and it was not until the
engineer Bousmard published Cormontaingne&rsquo;s <i>Mémorial de
l&rsquo;attaque des places</i> (Berlin, 1803) that Fourcroy, and after him
General La Fitte de Clavé, actually gave to the general public
the <i>&OElig;uvres posthumes de Cormontaingne</i> (Paris, 1806-1809).</p>

<p>His system of fortification was not marked by any great
originality of thought, which indeed could not be expected of
a member of the <i>corps du génie</i>, the characteristics of which were
a close caste spirit and an unquestioning reverence for the
authority of Vauban. Forts Moselle and Bellecroix are still
in existence.</p>

Illiger&rsquo;s term <i>Steganopodes</i>, of which it with its allies forms a
family <i>Phalacrocoracidae</i>.</p>

<p>The cormorant (<i>P. carbo</i>) frequents almost all the sea-coast
of Europe, and breeds in societies at various stations, most
generally on steep cliffs, but occasionally on rocky islands as well
as on trees. The nest consists of a large mass of sea-weed, and,
with the ground immediately surrounding it, generally looks as
though bespattered with whitewash, from the excrement of the
bird, which lives entirely on fish. The eggs, from four to six in
number, are small, and have a thick, soft, calcareous shell, bluish-white
when first laid, but soon becoming discoloured. The young
are hatched blind, and covered with an inky-black skin. They
remain for some time in the squab-condition, and are then highly
esteemed for food by the northern islanders, their flesh being
said to taste as well as a roasted hare&rsquo;s. Their first plumage
is of a sombre brownish-black above, and more or less white
beneath. They take two or three years to assume the fully adult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
dress, which is deep black, glossed above with bronze, and varied
in the breeding-season with white on the cheeks and flanks,
besides being adorned by filamentary feathers on the head, and
further set off by a bright yellow gape. The old cormorant looks
nearly as big as a goose, but is really much smaller; its flesh is
quite uneatable.</p>

<p>Taken when young from the nest, this bird is easily tamed and
can be trained to fish for its keeper, as was of old time commonly
done in England, where the master of the cormorants was one
of the officers of the royal household. Nowadays the practice
is nearly obsolete. When taken out to furnish sport, a strap is
fastened round the bird&rsquo;s neck so as, without impeding its breath,
to hinder it from swallowing its captures.<a name="FnAnchor_3d" id="FnAnchor_3d" href="#Footnote_3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Arrived at the
waterside, it is cast off. It at once dives and darts along the
bottom as swiftly as an arrow in quest of its prey, rapidly scanning
every hole or pool. A fish is generally seized within a few seconds
of its being sighted, and as each is taken the bird rises to the
surface with its capture in its bill. It does not take much longer
to dispose of the prize in the dilatable skin of its throat so far
as the strap will allow, and the pursuit is recommenced until
the bird&rsquo;s gular pouch, capacious as it is, will hold no more.
It then returns to its keeper, who has been anxiously watching
and encouraging its movements, and a little manipulation of
its neck effects the delivery of the booty. It may then be let
loose again, or, if considered to have done its work, it is fed and
restored to its perch. The activity the bird displays under water
is almost incredible to those who have not seen its performances,
and in a shallow river scarcely a fish escapes its keen eyes, and
sudden turns, except by taking refuge under a stone or root, or
in the mud that may be stirred up during the operation, and so
avoiding observation (see Salvin and Freeman, <i>Falconry</i>, 1859).</p>

<p>Nearly allied to the cormorant, and having much the same
habits, is the shag, or green cormorant of some writers (<i>P.
graculus</i>). The shag (which name in many parts of the world
is used in a generic sense) is, however, about one-fourth smaller
in linear dimensions, is much more glossy in plumage, and its
nuptial embellishment is a nodding plume instead of the white
patches of the cormorant. The easiest diagnostic on examination
will be found to be the number of tail-feathers, which in the
former are fourteen and in the shag twelve. The latter, too, is
more marine in the localities it frequents, scarcely ever entering
fresh or indeed inland waters.</p>

<p>In the south of Europe a much smaller species (<i>P. pygmaeus</i>)
is found. This is almost entirely a fresh-water bird, and is not
uncommon on the lower Danube. Other species, to the number
perhaps of thirty or more, have been discriminated from other
parts of the world, but all have a great general similarity to one
another. New Zealand and the west coast of northern America
are particularly rich in birds of this genus, and the species found
there are the most beautifully decorated of any. All, however,
are remarkable for their curiously-formed feet, the four toes
of each being connected by a web, for their long stiff tails, and
for the absence, in the adult, of any exterior nostrils. When
gorged, or when the state of the tide precludes fishing, they are
fond of sitting on an elevated perch, often with extended wings,
and in this attitude they will remain motionless for a considerable
time, as though hanging themselves out to dry. It was perhaps
this peculiarity that struck the observation of Milton, and
prompted his well-known similitude of Satan to a cormorant
(<i>Parad. Lost</i>, iv. 194); but when not thus behaving they themselves
provoke the more homely comparison of a row of black
bottles. Their voracity is proverbial.</p>

grain), originally meaning a small hard particle or grain, as of
sand, salt, gunpowder, &amp;c. It thus came to be applied to the
small hard seed of a plant, as still used in the words barley-corn
and pepper-corn. In agriculture it is generally applied to the
seed of the cereal plants. It is often locally understood to mean
that kind of cereal which is the leading crop of the district;
thus in England it refers to wheat, in Scotland and Ireland to
oats, and in the United States to maize (Indian corn). See

<p><span class="bold">CORN<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>cornu</i>, horn), in pathology (technically
<i>clavus</i>), a localized outgrowth of the epidermic layer of the skin,
most commonly of the toe, with a central ingrowth of a hard
horny plug. The underlying papillae are atrophied, causing a
cup-shaped hollow, whilst the surrounding papillae are hyper-trophied.
The condition is mainly caused by badly fitting boots,
though any undue pressure, of insufficient power to give rise
to ulceration, may be the cause of a corn. Corns may be hard
or soft. The hard corn usually occurs on one of the toes, is a
more or less conical swelling and may be extremely painful at
times. If suppuration occurs around the corn, it is apt to
burrow, and if unattended to may give rise to arthritis or even
necrosis. The best treatment is to soften the corn with hot
water, pare it very carefully with a sharp knife, and then paint
it with a solution of salicylic acid in collodion. The painting
must be repeated three times a day for a week or ten days. The
soft corn occurs between the toes and is usually a more painful
condition. Owing to the absorption of sweat its surface may
become white and sodden in appearance. The treatment is
much the same, but spirits of camphor should be painted on
each night, and a layer of cotton wool placed between the toes
during the daytime.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNARO, CATERINA<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (1454-1510), queen of Cyprus, was
the daughter of Marco Cornaro, a Venetian noble, whose brother
Andrea was an intimate friend of James de Lusignan, natural
son of King John II. of Cyprus. In the king&rsquo;s death in 1458
the succession was disputed, and James, with the help of the
sultan of Egypt, seized the island. But several powers were
arrayed against him&mdash;the duke of Savoy, who claimed the island
on the strength of the marriage of his son Louis to Charlotte,
the only legitimate daughter of John II.,<a name="FnAnchor_1e" id="FnAnchor_1e" href="#Footnote_1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the Genoese, and the
pope. It was important that he should make a marriage such
as would secure him powerful support. Andrea Cornaro suggested
his niece Caterina, famed for her beauty, as that union would
bring him Venetian help. The proposal was agreed to, and
approved of by Caterina herself and the senate, and the contract
was signed in 1468. But further intrigues caused delay, and
it was not until 1471 that James&rsquo;s hesitations were overcome.
Caterina was solemnly adopted by the doge as a &ldquo;daughter of
the Republic&rdquo; and sailed for Cyprus in 1472 with the title of
queen of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia. But she only enjoyed
one year of happiness, for in 1473 her husband died of fever,
leaving his kingdom to his queen and their child as yet unborn.
Enemies and rival claimants arose on all sides, for Cyprus was
a tempting bait. In August the child James III. was born, but
as soon as the Venetian fleet sailed away a plot to depose him
in favour of Zarla, James&rsquo;s illegitimate daughter, broke out,
and Caterina was kept a prisoner. The Venetians returned,
and order was soon restored, but the republic was meditating
the seizure of Cyprus, although it had no valid title whatever,
and after the death of Caterina&rsquo;s child in 1474 it was Venice
which really governed the island. The poor queen was surrounded
by intrigues and plots, and although the people of the coast
towns loved her, the Cypriot nobles were her bitter enemies and
hostile to Venetian influence. In 1488 the republic, fearing that
Sultan Bayezid II. intended to attack Cyprus, and having also
discovered a plot to marry Caterina to King Alphonso II. of
Naples, a proposal to which she seemed not averse, decided to
recall the queen to Venice and formally annex the island.
Caterina at first refused, for she clung to her royalty, but Venice
was a severe parent to its adopted daughter and would not be
gainsaid; she was forced to abdicate in favour of the republic,
and returned to Venice in 1489. The government conferred on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
her the castle and town of Asolo for life, and there in the midst
of a learned and brilliant little court, of which Cardinal Bembo
(q.v.) was a shining light, she spent the rest of her days in idyllic
peace. She died in July 1510. Titian&rsquo;s famous portrait of her
is in the Uffizi gallery in Florence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNARO, LUIGI<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1467-1566), a Venetian nobleman, famous
for his treatises on a temperate life. In his youth he lived freely,
but after a severe illness at the age of forty, he began under
medical advice gradually to reduce his diet. For some time he
restricted himself to a daily allowance of 12 oz. of solid food and
14 oz. of wine; later in life he reduced still further his bill of
fare, and found he could support his life and strength with no
more solid meat than an egg a day. At the age of eighty-three
he wrote his treatise on <i>The Sure and Certain Method of Attaining
a Long and Healthful Life</i>, the English translation of which went
through numerous editions; and this was followed by three
others on the same subject, composed at the ages of eighty-six,
ninety-one and ninety-five respectively. The first three were
published at Padua in 1558. They are written, says Addison
(<i>Spectator</i>, No. 195), &ldquo;with such a spirit of cheerfulness, religion
and good sense, as are the natural concomitants of temperance
and sobriety.&rdquo; He died at Padua at the age of ninety-eight.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNBRASH,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> in geology, the name applied to the uppermost
member of the Bathonian stage of the Jurassic formation in
England. It is an old English agricultural name applied in
Wiltshire to a variety of loose rubble or &ldquo;brash&rdquo; which, in that
part of the country, forms a good soil for growing corn. The
name was adopted by William Smith for a thin band of shelly
limestone which, in the south of England, breaks up in the
manner indicated. Although only a thin group of rocks (10-25
ft.), it is remarkably persistent; it may be traced from Weymouth
to the Yorkshire coast, but in north Lincolnshire it is very thin,
and probably dies out in the neighbourhood of the Humber.
It appears again, however, as a thin bed in Gristhorpe Bay,
Cayton Bay, Wheatcroft, Newton Dale and Langdale. In the
inland exposures in Yorkshire it is difficult to follow on account
of its thinness, and the fact that it passes up into dark shales
in many places&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;clays of the Cornbrash,&rdquo; with
<i>Avicula echinata</i>.</p>

<p>The Cornbrash is a very fossiliferous formation; the fauna
indicates a transition from the Lower to the Middle Oolites,
though it is probably more nearly related to that of the beds
above than to those below. Good localities for fossils are
Radipole near Weymouth, Closworth, Wincanton, Trowbridge,
Cirencester, Witney, Peterborough and Sudbrook Park near
Lincoln. A few of the important fossils are: <i>Waldheimia
lagenalis</i>, <i>Pecten levis</i>, <i>Avicula echinata</i>, <i>Ostrea flabelloides</i>,
<i>Myacites decurtatus</i>, <i>Echinobrissus clunicularis</i>; <i>Macrocephalites
macrocephalus</i> is abundant in the midland counties but rarer
in the south; belemnites are not known. The remains of
saurians (<i>Steneosaurus</i>) are occasionally found. The Cornbrash
is of little value for building or road-making, although it is used
locally; in the south of England it is not oolitic, but in Yorkshire
it is a rubbly, marly, frequently ironshot oolitic limestone.
In Bedfordshire it has been termed the Bedford limestone.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNEILLE, PIERRE<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (1606-1684), French dramatist and
poet, was born at Rouen, in the rue de la Pie, on the 6th of June
1606. The house, which was long preserved, was destroyed
not many years ago. His father, whose Christian name was the
same, was <i>avocat du roi à la Table de Marbre du Palais</i>, and also
held the position of <i>maître des eaux et forêts</i> in the <i>vicomté</i>
(or <i>bailliage</i>, as some say) of Rouen. In this latter office he is
said to have shown himself a vigorous magistrate, suppressing
brigandage and plunder without regard to his personal safety.
He was ennobled in 1637 (it is said not without regard to his
son&rsquo;s distinction), and the honour was renewed in favour of his
sons Pierre and Thomas in 1669, when a general repeal of the
letters of nobility recently granted had taken place. There
appears, however, to be no instance on record of the poet himself
assuming the &ldquo;de&rdquo; of nobility. His mother&rsquo;s name was Marthe
le Pesant.</p>

<p>After being educated by the Jesuits of Rouen, Corneille at
the age of eighteen was entered as <i>avocat</i>, and in 1624 took the
oaths, as we are told, four years before the regular time, a dispensation
having been procured. He was afterwards appointed
advocate to the admiralty, and to the &ldquo;waters and forests,&rdquo;
but both these posts must have been of small value, as we find
him parting with them in 1650 for the insignificant sum of 6000
livres. In that year and the next he was <i>procureur-syndic des
États de Normandie</i>. His first play, <i>Mélite</i>, was acted in 1629.
It is said by B. le B. de Fontenelle (his nephew) to have been
inspired by personal experiences, and was extremely popular,
either because or in spite of its remarkable difference from the
popular plays of the day, those of A. Hardy. In 1632 <i>Clitandre</i>,
a tragedy, was printed (it may have been acted in 1631); in
1633 <i>La Veuve</i> and the <i>Galerie du palais</i>, in 1634 <i>La Suivante</i> and
<i>La Place Royale</i>, all the last-named plays being comedies, saw
the stage. In 1634 also, having been selected as the composer
of a Latin elegy to Richelieu on the occasion of the cardinal
visiting Rouen, he was introduced to the subject of his verses,
and was soon after enrolled among the &ldquo;five poets.&rdquo; These
officers (the others being G. Colletet, Boisrobert and C. de
l&rsquo;Étoile, who in no way merited the title, and J. de Rotrou,
who was no unworthy yokefellow even of Corneille) had for task
the more profitable than dignified occupation of working up
Richelieu&rsquo;s ideas into dramatic form. No one could be less
suited for such work than Corneille, and he soon (it is said)
incurred his employer&rsquo;s displeasure by altering the plan of the
third act of <i>Les Thuileries</i>, which had been entrusted to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the year 1635 saw the production of <i>Médée</i>, a
grand but unequal tragedy. In the next year the singular
extravaganza entitled <i>L&rsquo;Illusion comique</i> followed, and was
succeeded about the end of November by the <i>Cid</i>, based on the
<i>Mocedades del Cid</i> of Guillem de Castro. The triumphant success
of this, perhaps the most &ldquo;epoch-making&rdquo; play in all literature,
the jealousy of Richelieu and the Academy, the open attacks of
Georges de Scudéry and J. de Mairet and others, and the pamphlet-war
which followed, are among the best-known incidents in the
history of letters. The trimming verdict of the Academy,
which we have in J. Chapelain&rsquo;s <i>Sentiments de l&rsquo;Académie
française sur la tragi-comédie du Cid</i> (1638), when its arbitration
was demanded by Richelieu, and not openly repudiated by
Corneille, was virtually unimportant; but it is worth remembering
that no less a writer than Georges de Scudéry, in his <i>Observations
sur le Cid</i> (1637), gravely and apparently sincerely asserted
and maintained of this great play that the subject was utterly
bad, that all the rules of dramatic composition were violated,
that the action was badly conducted, the versification constantly
faulty, and the beauties as a rule stolen! Corneille himself was
awkwardly situated in this dispute. The <i>esprit bourru</i> by which
he was at all times distinguished, and which he now displayed
in his rather arrogant <i>Excuse à Ariste</i>, unfitted him for controversy,
and it was of vital importance to him that he should not
lose the outward marks of favour which Richelieu continued to
show him. Perhaps the pleasantest feature in the whole matter
is the unshaken and generous admiration with which Rotrou,
the only contemporary whose genius <span class="correction" title="amended from entiled">entitled</span> him to criticise
Corneille, continued to regard his friend, rival, and in some
sense (though Rotrou was the younger of the two) pupil. Finding
it impossible to make himself fairly heard in the matter, Corneille
(who had retired from his position among the &ldquo;five poets&rdquo;)
withdrew to Rouen and passed nearly three years in quiet there,
perhaps revolving the opinions afterwards expressed in his
three <i>Discours</i> and in the <i>Examens</i> of his plays, where he bows,
somewhat as in the house of Rimmon, to &ldquo;the rules.&rdquo; In 1639,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
or at the beginning of 1640, appeared <i>Horace</i> with a dedication to
Richelieu. The good offices of Madame de Combalet, to whom
the <i>Cid</i> had been dedicated, and perhaps the satisfaction of the
cardinal&rsquo;s literary jealousy, had healed what breach there may
have been, and indeed the poet was in no position to quarrel
with his patron. Richelieu not only allowed him 500 crowns a
year, but soon afterwards, it is said, though on no certain
authority, employed his omnipotence in reconciling the father
of the poet&rsquo;s mistress, Marie de Lampérière, to the marriage
of the lovers (1640). In this year also <i>Cinna</i> appeared. A
brief but very serious illness attacked him, and the death of his
father the year before had increased his family anxieties by
leaving his mother in very indifferent circumstances. It has,
however, been recently denied that he himself was at any time
poor, as older traditions asserted.</p>

<p>In the following year Corneille figured as a contributor to
the <i>Guirlande de Julie</i>, a famous album which the marquis de
Montausier, assisted by all the literary men of the day, offered to
his lady-love, Julie d&rsquo;Angennes. 1643 was, according to the
latest authorities (for Cornelian dates have often been altered),
a very great year in the dramatist&rsquo;s life. Therein appeared
<i>Polyeucte</i>, the memorable comedy of <i>Le Menteur</i>, which though
adapted from the Spanish stood in relation to French comedy
very much as <i>Le Cid</i>, which owed less to Spain, stood to French
tragedy; its less popular and far less good <i>Suite</i>,&mdash;and perhaps
<i>La Mort de Pompée</i>. <i>Rodogune</i> (1644) was a brilliant success;
<i>Théodore</i> (1645), a tragedy on a somewhat perilous subject, was
the first of Corneille&rsquo;s plays which was definitely damned.
Some amends may have been made to him by the commission
which he received next year to write verses for the <i>Triomphes
poétiques de Louis XIII</i>. Soon after (22nd of January 1647)
the Academy at last (it had twice rejected him on frivolous pleas)
admitted the greatest of living French writers. <i>Héraclius</i> (1646),
<i>Andromède</i> (1650), a spectacle-opera rather than a play, <i>Don
Sanche d&rsquo;Aragon</i> (1650) and <i>Nicomède</i> (1651) were the products
of the next few years&rsquo; work; but in 1652 <i>Pertharite</i> was received
with decided disfavour, and the poet in disgust resolved, like
Ben Jonson, to quit the loathed stage. In this resolution he
persevered for six years, during which he worked at a verse
translation of the <i>Imitation of Christ</i> (finished in 1656), at his
three <i>Discourses on Dramatic Poetry</i>, and at the <i>Examens</i> which
are usually printed at the end of his plays. In 1659 Fouquet,
the Maecenas of the time, persuaded him to alter his resolve,
and <i>&OElig;dipe</i>, a play which became a great favourite with Louis
XIV., was the result. It was followed by <i>La Toison d&rsquo;or</i> (1660),
<i>Sertorius</i> (1662) and <i>Sophonisbe</i> (1663). In this latter year
Corneille (who had at last removed his residence from Rouen to
Paris in 1662) was included among the list of men of letters
pensioned at the proposal of Colbert. He received 2000 livres.
<i>Othon</i> (1664), <i>Agésilas</i> (1666), <i>Attila</i> (1667), and <i>Tite et Bérénice</i>
(1670), were generally considered as proofs of failing powers,&mdash;the
cruel quatrain of Boileau&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">in the case of these two plays, and the unlucky comparison with
Racine in the <i>Bérénice</i>, telling heavily against them. In 1665
and 1670 some versifications of devotional works addressed to
the Virgin had appeared. The part which Corneille took in
<i>Psyché</i> (1671), Molière and P. Quinault being his coadjutors,
showed signs of renewed vigour; but <i>Pulchérie</i> (1672) and
<i>Suréna</i> (1674) were allowed even by his faithful followers to be
failures. He lived for ten years after the appearance of <i>Suréna</i>,
but was almost silent save for the publication, in 1676, of some
beautiful verses thanking Louis XIV. for ordering the revival
of his plays. He died at his house in the rue d&rsquo;Argenteuil on
the 30th of September 1684. For nine years (1674-1681), and
again in 1683, his pension had, for what reason is unknown,
been suspended. It used to be said that he was in great straits,
and the story went (though, as far as Boileau is concerned, it
has been invalidated), that at last Boileau, hearing of this,
went to the king and offered to resign his own pension if there
were not money enough for Corneille, and that Louis sent the
aged poet two hundred pistoles. He might, had it actually been
so, have said, with a great English poet in like case, &ldquo;I have no
time to spend them.&rdquo; Two days afterwards he was dead.</p>

<p>Corneille was buried in the church of St Roch, where no
monument marked his grave until 1821. He had six children,
of whom four survived him. Pierre, the eldest son, a cavalry
officer who died before his father, left posterity in whom the
name has continued; Marie, the eldest daughter, was twice
married, and by her second husband, M. de Farcy, became the
ancestress of Charlotte Corday. Repeated efforts have been
made for the benefit of the poet&rsquo;s descendants, Voltaire, Charles
X. and the <i>Comédie française</i> having all borne part therein.</p>

<p>The portraits of Corneille (the best and most trustworthy of
which is from the burin of M. Lasne, an engraver of Caen),
represent him as a man of serious, almost of stern countenance,
and this agrees well enough with such descriptions as we have
of his appearance, and with the idea of him which we should form
from his writings and conduct. His nephew Fontenelle admits
that his general address and manner were by no means prepossessing.
Others use stronger language, and it seems to be
confessed that either from shyness, from pride, or from physical
defects of utterance, probably from all three combined, he did
not attract strangers. Racine is said to have assured his son
that Corneille made verses &ldquo;cent fois plus beaux&rdquo; than his own,
but that his own greater popularity was owing to the fact that
he took some trouble to make himself personally agreeable.
Almost all the anecdotes which have been recorded concerning
him testify to a rugged and somewhat unamiable self-contentment.
&ldquo;Je n&rsquo;ai pas le mérite de ce pays-ci,&rdquo; he said of the
court, &ldquo;Je n&rsquo;en suis pas moins Pierre Corneille,&rdquo; he is said
to have replied to his friends as often as they dared to suggest
certain shortcomings in his behaviour, manner or speech, &ldquo;Je
suis saoul de gloire et affamé d&rsquo;argent&rdquo; was his reply to the
compliments of Boileau. Yet tradition is unanimous as to his
affection for his family, and as to the harmony in which he lived
with his brother Thomas who had married Marguerite de Lampérière,
younger sister of Marie, and whose household both at
Rouen and at Paris was practically one with that of his brother.
No story about Corneille is better known than that which tells
of the trap between the two houses, and how Pierre, whose
facility of versification was much inferior to his brother&rsquo;s, would
lift it when hard bestead, and call out &ldquo;Sans-souci, une rime!&rdquo;
Notwithstanding this domestic felicity, an impression is left on
the reader of Corneille&rsquo;s biographies that he was by no means
a happy man. Melancholy of temperament will partially explain
this, but there were other reasons. He appears to have been
quite free from envy properly so called, and to have been always
ready to acknowledge the excellences of his contemporaries.
But, as was the case with a very different man&mdash;Goldsmith&mdash;praise
bestowed on others always made him uncomfortable
unless it were accompanied by praise bestowed on himself.
As Guizot has excellently said, &ldquo;Sa jalousie fut celle d&rsquo;un enfant
qui veut qu&rsquo;un sourire le rassure contre les caresses que reçoit
son frère.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although his actual poverty has been recently denied, he
cannot have been affluent. His pensions covered but a small
part of his long life and were most irregularly paid. He was no
&ldquo;dedicator,&rdquo; and the occasional presents of rich men, such as
Montauron (who gave him a thousand, others say two hundred,
pistoles for the dedication of <i>Cinna</i>), and Fouquet (who commissioned
<i>&OElig;dipe</i>), were few and far between, though they have
exposed him to reflections which show great ignorance of the
manners of the age. Of his professional earnings, the small sum
for which, as we have seen, he gave up his offices, and the expression
of Fontenelle that he practised &ldquo;sans goût et sans succès,&rdquo;
are sufficient proof. His patrimony and his wife&rsquo;s dowry must
both have been trifling. On the other hand, it was during the
early and middle part of his career impossible, and during the
later part very difficult, for a dramatist to live decently by his
pieces. It was not till the middle of the century that the custom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
of allowing the author two shares in the profits during the first
run of the piece was observed, and even then revivals profited
him nothing. Thomas Corneille himself, who to his undoubted
talents united wonderful facility, untiring industry, and (gift
valuable above all others to the playwright) an extraordinary
knack of hitting the public fancy, died, notwithstanding his
simple tastes, &ldquo;as poor as Job.&rdquo; We know that Pierre received
for two of his later pieces two thousand livres each, and we do not
know that he ever received more.</p>

<p>But his reward in fame was not stinted. Corneille, unlike
many of the great writers of the world, was not driven to wait
for &ldquo;the next age&rdquo; to do him justice. The cabal or clique which
attacked the <i>Cid</i> had no effect whatever on the judgment of the
public. All his subsequent masterpieces were received with the
same ungrudging applause, and the rising star of Racine, even
in conjunction with the manifest inferiority of Corneille&rsquo;s last
five or six plays, with difficulty prevailed against the older poet&rsquo;s
towering reputation. The great men of his time&mdash;Condé,
Turenne, the maréchal de Grammont, the knight-errant duc de
Guise&mdash;were his fervent admirers. Nor had he less justice done
him by a class from whom less justice might have been expected,
the brother men of letters whose criticisms he treated with such
scant courtesy. The respectable mediocrity of Chapelain might
misapprehend him; the lesser geniuses of Scudéry and Mairet
might feel alarm at his advent; the envious Claverets and
D&rsquo;Aubignacs might snarl and scribble. But Balzac did him
justice; Rotrou, as we have seen, never failed in generous
appreciation; Molière in conversation and in print recognized
him as his own master and the foremost of dramatists. We have
quoted the informal tribute of Racine; but it should not be
forgotten that Racine, in discharge of his duty as respondent at
the Academical reception of Thomas Corneille, pronounced upon
the memory of Pierre perhaps the noblest and most just tribute
of eulogy that ever issued from the lips of a rival. Boileau&rsquo;s
testimony is of a more chequered character; yet he seems never
to have failed in admiring Corneille whenever his principles would
allow him to do so. Questioned as to the great men of Louis
XIV.&rsquo;s reign, he is said to have replied: &ldquo;I only know three,&mdash;Corneille,
Molière and myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;And how about Racine?&rdquo;
his auditor ventured to remark. &ldquo;He was an extremely clever
fellow to whom I taught the art of elaborate rhyming&rdquo; (<i>rimer
difficilement</i>). It was reserved for the 18th century to exalt
Racine above Corneille. Voltaire, who was prompted by his
natural benevolence to comment on the latter (the profits went
to a relation of the poet), was not altogether fitted by nature to
appreciate Corneille, and moreover, as has been ingeniously
pointed out, was not a little wearied by the length of his task.
His partially unfavourable verdict was endorsed earlier by
Vauvenargues, who knew little of poetry, and later by La Harpe,
whose critical standpoint has now been universally abandoned.
Napoleon I. was a great admirer of Corneille (&ldquo;s&rsquo;il vivait, je le
ferais prince,&rdquo; he said), and under the Empire and the Restoration
an approach to a sounder appreciation was made. But it was
the glory of the romantic school, or rather of the more catholic
study of letters which that school brought about, to restore
Corneille to his true rank. So long, indeed, as a certain kind of
criticism was pursued, due appreciation was impossible. When
it was thought sufficient to say with Boileau that Corneille
excited, not pity or terror, but admiration which was not a
tragic passion; or that</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">when Voltaire could think it crushing to add to his exposure of
the &ldquo;infamies&rdquo; of <i>Théodore</i>&mdash;&ldquo;après cela comment osons-nous
condamner les pièces de Lope de Véga et de Shakespeare?&rdquo;&mdash;it
is obvious that the <i>Cid</i> and <i>Polyeucte</i>, much more <i>Don Sanche
d&rsquo;Aragon</i> and <i>Rodogune</i>, were sealed books to the critic.</p>

<p>Almost the first thing which strikes a reader is the singular
inequality of this poet, and the attempts to explain this inequality,
in reference to his own and other theories, leave the
fact untouched. Producing, as he certainly has produced, work
which classes him with the greatest names in literature, he has
also signed an extraordinary quantity of verse which has not
merely the defects of genius, irregularity, extravagance, <i>bizarreté</i>,
but the faults which we are apt to regard as exclusively belonging
to those who lack genius, to wit, the dulness and tediousness of
mediocrity. Molière&rsquo;s manner of accounting for this is famous
in literary history or legend. &ldquo;My friend Corneille,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;has a familiar who inspires him with the finest verses in the
world. But sometimes the familiar leaves him to shift for
himself, and then he fares very badly.&rdquo; That Corneille was by
no means destitute of the critical faculty his <i>Discourses</i> and the
<i>Examens</i> of his plays (often admirably acute, and, with Dryden&rsquo;s
subsequent prefaces, the originals to a great extent of specially
modern criticism) show well enough. But an enemy might
certainly contend that a poet&rsquo;s critical faculty should be of the
Promethean, not be Epimethean order. The fact seems to be
that the form in which Corneille&rsquo;s work was cast, and which by an
odd irony of fate he did so much to originate and make popular,
was very partially suited to his talents. He could imagine
admirable situations, and he could write verses of incomparable
grandeur&mdash;verses that reverberate again and again in the
memory, but he could not, with the patient docility of Racine,
labour at proportioning the action of a tragedy strictly, at
maintaining a uniform rate of interest in the course of the plot
and of excellence in the fashion of the verse. Especially in his
later plays a verse and a couplet will crash out with fulgurous
brilliancy, and then be succeeded by pages of very second-rate
declamation or argument. It was urged against him also by the
party of the <i>Doucereux</i>, as he called them, that he could not
manage, or did not attempt, the great passion of love, and that
except in the case of Chimène his principle seemed to be that of
one of his own heroines:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 13em;">(Aristie in <i>Sertorius</i>.)</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">There is perhaps some truth in this accusation, however much
some of us may be disposed to think that the line just quoted
is a fair enough description of the admired ecstasies of Achille
and Bajazet. But these are all the defects which can be fairly
urged against him; and in a dramatist bound to a less strict
service they would hardly have been even remarked. They
certainly neither require, nor are palliated by, theories of his
&ldquo;megalomania,&rdquo; of his excessive attention to conflicts of will
and the like. On the English stage the liberty of unrestricted
incident and complicated action, the power of multiplying
characters and introducing prose scenes, would have exactly
suited his somewhat intermittent genius, both by covering
defects and by giving greater scope for the exhibition of power.</p>

<p>How great that power is can escape no one. The splendid
soliloquies of Medea which, as Voltaire happily says, &ldquo;annoncent
Corneille,&rdquo; the entire parts of Rodogune and Chimène, the final
speech of Camille in <i>Horace</i>, the discovery scene of <i>Cinna</i>, the
dialogues of Pauline and Sévère in <i>Polyeucte</i>, the magnificently-contrasted
conception and exhibition of the best and worst forms
of feminine dignity in the Cornélie of <i>Pompée</i> and the Cléopâtre
of <i>Rodogune</i>, the singularly fine contrast in <i>Don Sanche d&rsquo;Aragon</i>,
between the haughtiness of the Spanish nobles and the unshaken
dignity of the supposed adventurer Carlos, and the characters
of Aristie, Viriate and Sertorius himself, in the play named after
the latter, are not to be surpassed in grandeur of thought,
felicity of design or appropriateness of language. &ldquo;Admiration&rdquo;
may or may not properly be excited by tragedy, and until
this important question is settled the name of tragedian may be
at pleasure given to or withheld from the author of <i>Rodogune</i>.
But his rank among the greatest of dramatic poets is not a
matter of question. For a poet is to be judged by his best things,
and the best things of Corneille are second to none.</p>

<p><i>The Plays.</i>&mdash;It was, however, some time before his genius
came to perfection. It is undeniable that the first six or seven
of his plays are of no very striking intrinsic merit. On the other
hand, it requires only a very slight acquaintance with the state of
the drama in France at the time to see that these works, poor as
they may now seem, must have struck the spectators as something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
new and surprising. The language and dialogue of <i>Mélite</i> are
on the whole simple and natural, and though the construction is
not very artful (the fifth act being, as is not unusual in Corneille,
superfluous and clumsy), it is still passable. The fact that one
of the characters jumps on another&rsquo;s back, and the rather
promiscuous kissing which takes place, are nothing to the
liberties usually taken in contemporary plays. A worse fault
is the <span class="grk" title="stichomythia">&#963;&#964;&#953;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#965;&#952;&#943;&#945;</span>, or, to borrow Butler&rsquo;s expression, the Cat-and-Puss
dialogue, which abounds. But the common objection to
the play at the time was that it was <i>too</i> natural and too devoid
of striking incidents. Corneille accordingly, as he tells us, set
to work to cure these faults, and produced a truly wonderful
work, <i>Clitandre</i>. Murders, combats, escapes and outrages of all
kinds are provided; and the language makes <i>The Rehearsal</i> no
burlesque. One of the heroines rescues herself from a ravisher
by blinding him with a hair-pin, and as she escapes the seducer
apostrophizes the blood which trickles from his eye, and the
weapon which has wounded it, in a speech forty verses long.
This, however, was his only attempt of the kind. For his next
four pieces, which were comedies, there is claimed the introduction
of some important improvements, such as the choosing for scenes
places well known in actual life (as in the <i>Galerie du palais</i>), and
the substitution of the soubrette in place of the old inconvenient
and grotesque nurse. It is certain, however, that there is more
interval between these six plays and <i>Médée</i> than between the
latter and Corneille&rsquo;s greatest drama. Here first do we find
those sudden and magnificent lines which characterize the poet.
The title-rôle is, however, the only good one, and as a whole the
play is heavy. Much the same may be said of its curious successor
<i>L&rsquo;Illusion comique</i>. This is not only a play within a play, but
in part of it there is actually a <i>third</i> involution, one set of characters
beholding another set discharging the parts of yet another.
It contains, however, some very fine lines, in particular, a
defence of the stage and some heroics put into the mouth of a
braggadocio. We have seen it said of the <i>Cid</i> that it is difficult
to understand the enthusiasm it excited. But the difficulty
can only exist for persons who are insensible to dramatic excellence,
or who so strongly object to the forms of the French
drama that they cannot relish anything so presented. Rodrigue,
Chimène, Don Diègue are not of any age, but of all time. The
conflicting passions of love, honour, duty, are here represented
as they never had been on a French stage, and in the &ldquo;strong
style&rdquo; which was Corneille&rsquo;s own. Of the many objections
urged against the play, perhaps the weightiest is that which
condemns the frigid and superfluous part of the Infanta. <i>Horace</i>,
though more skilfully constructed, is perhaps less satisfactory.
There is a hardness about the younger Horace which might have
been, but is not made, imposing, and Sabine&rsquo;s effect on the action
is quite out of proportion to the space she occupies. The splendid
declamation of Camille, and the excellent part of the elder
Horace, do not altogether atone for these defects. <i>Cinna</i> is
perhaps generally considered the poet&rsquo;s masterpiece, and it
undoubtedly contains the finest single scene in all French
tragedy. The blot on it is certainly the character of Émilie,
who is spiteful and thankless, not heroic. <i>Polyeucte</i> has sometimes
been elevated to the same position. There is, however,
a certain coolness about the hero&rsquo;s affection for his wife which
somewhat detracts from the merit of his sacrifice; while the
Christian part of the matter is scarcely so well treated as in the
<i>Saint Genest</i> of Rotrou or the <i>Virgin Martyr</i> of Massinger. On
the other hand, the entire parts of Pauline and Sévère are beyond
praise, and the manner in which the former reconciles her duty
as a wife with her affection for her lover is an astonishing success.
In <i>Pompée</i> (for <i>La Mort de Pompée</i>, though the more appropriate,
was not the original title) the splendid declamation of Cornélie is
the chief thing to be remarked. <i>Le Menteur</i> fully deserves the
honour which Molière paid to it. Its continuation, notwithstanding
the judgment of some French critics, we cannot think so
happy. But <i>Théodore</i> is perhaps the most surprising of literary
anomalies. The central situation, which so greatly shocked
Voltaire and indeed all French critics from the date of the piece,
does not seem to blame. A virgin martyr who is threatened
with loss of honour as a bitterer punishment than loss of life
offers points as powerful as they are perilous. But the treatment
is thoroughly bad. From the heroine who is, in a phrase of
Dryden&rsquo;s, &ldquo;one of the coolest and most insignificant&rdquo; heroines
ever drawn, to the undignified Valens, the termagant Marcelle,
and the peevish Placide, there is hardly a good character. Immediately
upon this in most printed editions, though older in
representation, follows the play which (therein agreeing rather
with the author than with his critics) we should rank as his
greatest triumph, <i>Rodogune</i>. Here there is hardly a weak point.
The magnificent and terrible character of Cléopâtre, and the
contrasted dispositions of the two princes, of course attract
most attention. But the character of Rodogune herself, which
has not escaped criticism, comes hardly short of these. <i>Héraclius</i>,
despite great art and much fine poetry, is injured by the extreme
complication of its argument and by the blustering part of
Pulchérie. <i>Andromède</i>, with the later spectacle piece, the
<i>Toison d&rsquo;or</i>, do not call for comment, and we have already
alluded to the chief merit of <i>Don Sanche</i>. <i>Nicomède</i>, often
considered one of Corneille&rsquo;s best plays, is chiefly remarkable
for the curious and unusual character of its hero. Of <i>Pertharite</i>
it need only be said that no single critic has to our knowledge
disputed the justice of its damnation. <i>&OElig;dipe</i> is certainly
unworthy of its subject and its author, but in <i>Sertorius</i> we have
one of Corneille&rsquo;s finest plays. It is remarkable not only for
its many splendid verses and for the nobility of its sentiment,
but from the fact that not one of its characters lacks interest, a
commendation not generally to be bestowed on its author&rsquo;s
work. Of the last six plays we may say that perhaps only one
of them, <i>Agésilas</i>, is almost wholly worthless. Not a few
speeches of <i>Suréna</i> and of <i>Othon</i> are of a very high order. As to
the poet&rsquo;s non-dramatic works, we have already spoken of his
extremely interesting critical dissertations. His minor poems
and poetical devotions are not likely to be read save from
motives of duty or curiosity. The verse translation of à Kempis,
indeed, which was in its day immensely popular (it passed
through many editions), condemns itself.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The subject of the bibliography of Corneille was
treated in the most exhaustive manner by M. E. Picot in his <i>Bibliographie
Cornélienne</i> (Paris, 1875-1876). Less elaborate, but still
ample information may be found in J. A. Taschereau&rsquo;s <i>Vie</i> and in
M. Marty-Laveaux&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Works</i>. The individual plays
were usually printed a year or two after their first appearance:
but these dates have been subjected to confusion and to controversy,
and it seems better to refer for them to the works quoted and to be
quoted. The chief collected editions in the poet&rsquo;s lifetime were
those of 1644, 1648, 1652, 1660 (with important corrections), 1664
and 1682, which gives the definitive text. In 1692 T. Corneille published
a complete <i>Théâtre</i> in 5 vols. 12mo. Numerous editions
appeared in the early part of the 18th century, that of 1740 (6 vols.
12mo, Amsterdam) containing the <i>&OElig;uvres diverses</i> as well as the
plays. Several editions are recorded between this and that of
Voltaire (12 vols. 8vo; Geneva, 1764, 1776, 8 vols. 4to), whose
<i>Commentaires</i> have often been reprinted separately. In the year IX.
(1801) appeared an edition of the <i>Works</i> with Voltaire&rsquo;s commentary
and criticisms thereon by Palissot (12 vols. 8vo, Paris). Since this
the editions have been extremely numerous. Those chiefly to be
remarked are the following. Lefèvre&rsquo;s (12 vols. 8vo, Paris, 1854),
well printed and with a useful variorum commentary, lacks bibliographical
information and is disfigured by hideous engravings.
Of Taschereau&rsquo;s, in the <i>Bibliothèque elzévirienne</i>, only two volumes
were published. Lahure&rsquo;s appeared in 5 vols. (1857-1862) and 7
vols. (1864-1866). The edition of Ch. Marty-Laveaux in Regnier&rsquo;s
<i>Grands Écrivains de la France</i> (1862-1868), in 12 vols. 8vo, is still the
standard. In appearance and careful editing it leaves nothing to
desire, containing the entire works, a lexicon, full bibliographical
information, and an album of illustrations of the poet&rsquo;s places of
residence, his arms, some title-pages of his plays, facsimiles of his
writings, &amp;c. Nothing is wanting but variorum comments, which
Lefèvre&rsquo;s edition supplies. Fontenelle&rsquo;s life of his uncle is the chief
original authority on that subject, but Taschereau&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de la vie
et des ouvrages de P. Corneille</i> (1st ed. 1829, 2nd in the <i>Bibl. elzévirienne</i>,
1855) is the standard work. Its information has been corrected
and augmented in various later publications, but not materially.
Of the exceedingly numerous writings relative to Corneille we may
mention the <i>Recueil de dissertations sur plusieurs tragédies de Corneille
et de Racine</i> of the abbé Granet (Paris, 1740), the criticisms already
alluded to of Voltaire, La Harpe and Palissot, the well-known work
of Guizot, first published as <i>Vie de Corneille</i> in 1813 and revised as
<i>Corneille et son temps</i> in 1852, and the essays, repeated in his <i>Portraits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
littéraires</i>, in <i>Port-Royal</i>, and in the <i>Nouveaux Lundis</i> of Sainte-Beuve.
More recently, besides essays by MM. Brunetière, Faguet and
Lemaître and the part appurtenant of M. E. Rigal&rsquo;s work on 16th
century drama in France, see Gustave Lanson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Corneille&rdquo; in the
<i>Grands Écrivains français</i> (1898); F. Bouquet&rsquo;s <i>Points obscurs et
nouveaux de la vie de Pierre Corneille</i> (1888); <i>Corneille inconnu</i>, by
J. Levallois (1876); J. Lemaître, <i>Corneille et la poétique d&rsquo;Aristote</i>
(1888); J. B. Segall, <i>Corneille and the Spanish Drama</i> (1902); and
the recently discovered and printed <i>Fragments sur Pierre et Thomas
Corneille</i> of Alfred de Vigny (1905). On the <i>Cid</i> quarrel E. H.
Chardon&rsquo;s <i>Vie de Rotrou</i> (1884) bears mainly on a whole series of
documents which appeared at Rouen in the proceedings of the
<i>Société des bibliophiles normands</i> during the years 1891-1894. The
best-known English criticism, that of Hallam in his <i>Literature of
Europe</i>, is inadequate. The translations of separate plays are very
numerous, but of the complete <i>Théâtre</i> only one version (into Italian)
is recorded by the French editors. Fontenelle tells us that his uncle
had translations of the <i>Cid</i> in every European tongue but Turkish
and Slavonic, and M. Picot&rsquo;s book apprises us that the latter want,
at any rate, is now supplied. Corneille has suffered less than some
other writers from the attribution of spurious works. Besides a
tragedy, <i>Sylla</i>, the chief piece thus assigned is <i>L&rsquo;Occasion perdue
recouverte</i>, a rather loose tale in verse. Internal evidence by no
means fathers it on Corneille, and all external testimony is against
it. It has never been included in Corneille&rsquo;s works. It is curious
that a translation of Statius (<i>Thebaid</i>, bk. iii.), an author of whom
Corneille was extremely fond, though known to have been written,
printed and published, has entirely dropped out of sight. Three
verses quoted by Ménage are all we possess.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORNEILLE, THOMAS<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (1625-1709), French dramatist, was
born at Rouen on the 20th of August 1625, being nearly twenty
years younger than his brother, the great Corneille. His skill
in verse-making seems to have shown itself early, as at the age
of fifteen he composed a piece in Latin which was represented
by his fellow-pupils at the Jesuits&rsquo; college of Rouen. His first
French play, <i>Les Engagements du hasard</i>, was acted in 1647.
<i>Le Feint Astrologue</i>, imitated from the Spanish, and imitated by
Dryden, came next year. At his brother&rsquo;s death he succeeded
to his vacant chair in the Academy. He then turned his attention
to philology, producing a new edition of the <i>Remarques</i> of C. F.
Vaugelas in 1687, and in 1694 a dictionary of technical terms,
intended to supplement that of the Academy. A complete
translation of Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i> (he had published six books
with the <i>Heroic Epistles</i> some years previously) followed in 1697.
In 1704 he lost his sight and was constituted a &ldquo;veteran,&rdquo; a
dignity which preserved to him the privileges, while it exempted
him from the duties, of an academician. But he did not allow
his misfortune to put a stop to his work, and in 1708 produced a
large <i>Dictionnaire universel géographique et historique</i> in three
volumes folio. This was his last labour. He died at Les Andelys
on the 8th of December 1709, aged eighty-four. It has been the
custom to speak of Thomas Corneille as of one who, but for the
name he bore, would merit no notice. This is by no means the
case; on the contrary, he is rather to be commiserated for his
connexion with a brother who outshone him as he would have
outshone almost any one. But the two were strongly attached
to one another, and practically lived in common. Of his forty-two
plays (this is the utmost number assigned to him) the last
edition of his complete works contains only thirty-two, but he
wrote several in conjunction with other authors. Two are
usually reprinted as his masterpieces at the end of his brother&rsquo;s
selected works. These are <i>Ariane</i> (1672) and the <i>Comte d&rsquo; Essex</i>,
in the former of which Rachel attained success. But of <i>Laodice</i>,
<i>Camma</i>, <i>Stilica</i> and some other pieces, Pierre Corneille himself
said that &ldquo;he wished he had written them,&rdquo; and he was not
wont to speak lightly. <i>Camma</i> (1661, on the same story as
Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Cup</i>) especially deserves notice. Thomas Corneille is
in many ways remarkable in the literary gossip-history of his
time. His <i>Timocrate</i> boasted of the longest run (80 nights)
recorded of any play in the century. For <i>La Devineresse</i> he
and his coadjutor de Visé (1638-1710, founder of the <i>Mercure
galant</i>, to which Thomas contributed) received above 6000 livres,
the largest sum known to have been thus paid. Lastly, one of
his pieces (<i>Le Baron des Fondrières</i>) contests the honour of being
the first which was hissed off the stage.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNELIA<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (2nd cent. B.C.), daughter of Scipio Africanus the
Elder, mother of the Gracchi and of Sempronia, the wife of Scipio
Africanus the Younger. On the death of her husband, refusing
numerous offers of marriage, she devoted herself to the education
of her twelve children. She was so devoted to her sons Tiberius
and Gaius that it was even asserted that she was concerned in
the death of her son-in-law Scipio, who by his achievements had
eclipsed the fame of the Gracchi, and was said to have approved
of the murder of Tiberius. When asked to show her jewels she
presented her sons, and on her death a statue was erected to her
memory inscribed, &ldquo;Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi.&rdquo;
After the murder of her second son Gaius she retired to Misenum,
where she devoted herself to Greek and Latin literature, and to
the society of men of letters. She was a highly educated woman,
and her letters were celebrated for their beauty of style. The
genuineness of the two fragments of a letter from her to her son
Gaius, printed in some editions of Cornelius Nepos, is disputed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNELIUS,<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> pope, was elected in 251 during the lull in the
persecution of the emperor Decius. Two years afterwards, under
the emperor Gallus, he was exiled to Centumcellae (Civita
Vecchia), where he died. He was very intimate with St Cyprian,
and is commemorated with him on the 16th of September, which
is not, however, the anniversary of his death. He died in June
253.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORNELIUS, CARL AUGUST PETER<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1824-1874), German
musician and poet, son of an actor at Wiesbaden, grandson of
the engraver Ignaz Cornelius, and nephew of Cornelius the
painter, was born at Mainz on the 24th of December 1824. In
his childhood his bent was towards languages, but his musical
gifts were carefully cultivated and he learned to sing and to
play the violin. Cornelius the elder, anxious for his son to
become an actor, himself taught the boy the elements of the art.
These theatrical studies, however, were interrupted early by a
visit paid by Peter Cornelius to England as second violin in the
Mainz orchestra. On returning home young Cornelius made his
stage debut as John Cook in <i>Kean</i>. But after two more appearances,
as the lover in the comedy <i>Das war Ich</i> and as Perin in
Moreto&rsquo;s <i>Donna Diana</i>, he practically abandoned the stage for
music, his idea being to become a comic opera composer. In
1843 his father died. Hitherto Cornelius&rsquo;s musical studies had
been unsystematic. Now opportunity served to remedy this,
for his relative, Cornelius the painter, summoned him in 1844
to Berlin, and enabled him a year later to become a pupil of
Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn (1799-1858), counterpoint and theory
generally being worked at laboriously. After leaving Dehn,
Cornelius proved his independence by writing a trio in A minor,
a quartet in C, as well as two comic opera texts. In 1847 he
returned to Dehn and immediately composed an enormous mass
of music, including a second trio, 30 vocal canons, several sonatas,
a Mass, a Stabat Mater; he also wrote a number of translations
of old French poems, which are classics of their kind. In 1852
he first came in touch with Liszt, through his uncle&rsquo;s instrumentality.
At Weimar, whither he went in 1852, he heard Berlioz&rsquo;s
delightful <i>Benvenuto Cellini</i>, a work which ultimately exercised
great influence over him. For the time, however, he devoted
himself, on Liszt&rsquo;s advice, to further Church compositions, the
influence of the Church on him at that time being so great that
he applied, but vainly, for a place in a Jesuit college. Still his
mind was bent on the production of a comic opera, but the
composition was long delayed by the work of translating the
prefaces for Liszt&rsquo;s symphonic poems and the texts of works by
Berlioz and Rubinstein. Between October 1855 and September
in the following year, Cornelius wrote the book of the <i>Barbier von
Bagdad</i>, and on December 15, 1858, the opera was produced at
Weimar under Liszt, and hissed off the stage. Thereupon Liszt
resigned his post, and shortly afterwards Cornelius went to
Vienna and Munich, and still later came very much under
Wagner&rsquo;s influence. Cornelius&rsquo;s <i>Cid</i> was completed and produced
at Weimar in 1865. For the last nine years of his life (1865-1874)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
Cornelius was occupied with his opera <i>Gunlöd</i> and other compositions,
besides writing ably and abundantly on Wagner&rsquo;s
music-dramas. In 1867 he became teacher of rhetoric and
harmony at the Musikschule, Munich, and married Berthe Jung.
He died on the 26th of October 1874. Not the least of Cornelius&rsquo;s
many claims to fame was his remarkable versatility. Many of
his original poems, as well as his translations from the French,
rank high. Among his songs, special mention may be made of
the lovely &ldquo;Weihnachtslieder,&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;Vätergruft,&rdquo; an
unaccompanied vocal work for baritone solo and choir.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORNELIUS, PETER VON<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1784-1867), German painter,
was born in Düsseldorf in 1784. His father, who was inspector
of the Düsseldorf gallery, died in 1799, and the young Cornelius
was stimulated to extraordinary exertions. In a letter to the
Count Raczynski he says, &ldquo;It fell to the lot of an elder brother
and myself to watch over the interests of a numerous family.
It was at this time that it was attempted to persuade my mother
that it would be better for me to devote myself to the trade of
a goldsmith than to continue to pursue painting&mdash;in the first
place, in consequence of the time necessary to qualify me for the
art, and in the next, because there were already so many painters.
My dear mother, however, rejected all this advice, and I felt
myself impelled onward by an uncontrollable enthusiasm, to
which the confidence of my mother gave new strength, which
was supported by the continual fear that I should be removed
from the study of that art I loved so much.&rdquo; His earliest work
of importance was the decoration of the choir of the church of
St Quirinus at Neuss. At the age of twenty-six he produced
his designs from <i>Faust</i>. On October 14, 1811, he arrived in
Rome, where he soon became one of the most promising of that
brotherhood of young German painters which included Overbeck,
Schadow, Veit, Schnorr and Ludwig Vogel (1788-1879),&mdash;a
fraternity (some of whom selected a ruinous convent for their
home) who were banded together for resolute study and mutual
criticism. Out of this association came the men who, though
they were ridiculed at the time, were destined to found a new
German school of art.</p>

<p>At Rome Cornelius participated, with other members of his
fraternity, in the decoration of the Casa Bartoldi and the Villa
Massimi, and while thus employed he was also engaged upon
designs for the illustration of the Nibelungenlied. From Rome
he was called to Düsseldorf to remodel the Academy, and to
Munich by the then crown-prince of Bavaria, afterwards Louis
I., to direct the decorations for the Glyptothek. Cornelius,
however, soon found that attention to such widely separated
duties was incompatible with the just performance of either,
and most inconvenient to himself; eventually, therefore, he
resigned his post at Düsseldorf to throw himself completely and
thoroughly into those works for which he had been commissioned
by the crown-prince. He therefore left Düsseldorf for Munich,
where he was joined by those of his pupils who elected to follow
and to assist him. At the death of Director Langer, 1824-1825,
he became director of the Munich Academy.</p>

<p>The fresco decorations of the Ludwigskirche, which were for
the most part designed and executed by Cornelius, are perhaps
the most important mural works of modern times. The large
fresco of the Last Judgment, over the high altar in that church,
measures 62 ft. in height by 38 ft. in width. The frescoes of the
Creator, the Nativity, and the Crucifixion in the same building
are also upon a large scale. Amongst his other great works in
Munich may be included his decorations in the Pinakothek and
in the Glyptothek; those in the latter building, in the hall of
the gods and the hall of the hero-myths, are perhaps the best
known. About the year 1839-1840 he left Munich for Berlin
to proceed with that series of cartoons, from the Apocalypse,
for the frescoes for which he had been commissioned by Frederick
William IV., and which were intended to decorate the Campo
Santo or royal mausoleum. These were his final works.</p>

<p>Cornelius, as an oil painter, possessed but little technical skill,
nor do his works exhibit any instinctive appreciation of colour.
Even as a fresco painter his manipulative power was not great.
And in critically examining the execution in colour of some of
his magnificent designs, one cannot help feeling that he was, in
this respect, unable to do them full justice. Cornelius and his
associates endeavoured to follow in their works the spirit of the
Italian painters. But the Italian strain is to a considerable
extent modified by the Dürer heritage. This Dürer influence
is manifest in a tendency to overcrowding in composition, in a
degree of attenuation in the proportions of, and a poverty of
contour in, the nude figure, and also in a leaning to the selection
of Gothic forms for draperies. These peculiarities are even
noticeable in Cornelius&rsquo;s principal work of the &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo;
in the Ludwigskirche in Munich. The attenuation and want
of flexibility of contour in the nude are perhaps most conspicuous
in his frescoes of classical subjects in the Glyptothek, especially
in that representing the contention for the body of Patroclus.
But notwithstanding these peculiarities there is always in his
works a grandeur and nobleness of conception, as all must
acknowledge who have inspected his designs for the Ludwigskirche,
for the Campo Santo, &amp;c. If he were not dexterous in
the handling of the brush, he could conceive and design a subject
with masterly purpose. If he had an imperfect eye for colour,
in the Venetian, the Flemish, or the English sense, he had vast
mental foresight in directing the German school of painting;
and his favourite motto of <i>Deutschland über alles</i> indicates the
direction and the strength of his patriotism. Karl Hermann
was one of Cornelius&rsquo;s earliest and most esteemed scholars, a
man of simple and fervent nature, painstaking to the utmost,
a very type of the finest German student nature; Kaulbach
and Adam Eberle were also amongst his scholars. Every public
edifice in Munich and other German cities which were embellished
with frescoes, became, as in Italy, a school of art of the very best
kind; for the decoration of a public building begets a practical
knowledge of design. The development of this institution of
scholarship in Munich was a work of time. The cartoons for
the Glyptothek were all by Cornelius&rsquo;s own hand. In the
Pinakothek his sketches and small drawings sufficed; but in the
Ludwigskirche the invention even of some of the subjects was
entrusted to his scholar Hermann.</p>

<p>To comprehend and appreciate thoroughly the magnitude of
the work which Cornelius accomplished for Germany, we must
remember that at the beginning of the 19th century Germany
had no national school of art. Germany was in painting and
sculpture behind all the rest of Europe. Yet in less than half
a century Cornelius founded a great school, revived mural
painting, and turned the gaze of the art world towards Munich.
The German revival of mural painting had its effect upon England,
as well as upon other European nations, and led to the famous
cartoon competitions held in Westminster Hall, and ultimately
to the partial decoration of the Houses of Parliament. When
the latter work was in contemplation, Cornelius, in response to
invitations, visited England (November 1841). His opinion
was in every way favourable to the carrying out of the project,
and even in respect of the durability of fresco in the climate of
England. Cornelius, in his teaching, always inculcated a close
and rigorous study of nature, but he understood by the study of
nature something more than what is ordinarily implied by that
expression, something more than constantly making studies from
life; he meant the study of nature with an inquiring and
scientific spirit. &ldquo;Study nature,&rdquo; was the advice he once gave,
&ldquo;in order that you may become acquainted with its <i>essential</i>
forms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The personal appearance of Cornelius could not but convey
to those who were fortunate enough to come into contact with
him the impression that he was a man of an energetic, firm and
resolute nature. He was below the middle height and squarely
built. There was evidence of power about his broad and overhanging
brow, in his eagle eyes and firmly gripped attenuated
lips, which no one with the least discernment could misinterpret.
Yet there was a sense of humour and a geniality which drew
men towards him; and towards those young artists who sought
his teaching and his criticism he always exhibited a calm
patience.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNELL UNIVERSITY,<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> one of the largest of American
institutions of higher education, situated at Ithaca, New York.
Its campus is finely situated on a hill above the main part of the
city; it lies between Fall Creek and Cascadilla Creek (each of
which has cut a deep gorge), and commands a beautiful view
of the valley and of Lake Cayuga. The university is co-educational
(since 1872), and comprises the graduate school, with
306 students in 1909; the college of arts and sciences (902
students); the college of law (225 students), established in 1887;
the medical college (217 students, of whom 29 were taking
freshman or sophomore work in Ithaca, where all women entering
the college must pursue the first two years of work)&mdash;this college
was established in 1898 by the gift of Oliver Hazard Payne, and
has buildings opposite Bellevue hospital on First Avenue and
28th Street, New York city; the New York state veterinary
college (94 students), established by the state legislature in 1894;
the New York state college of agriculture (413 students), established
as such by the state legislature in 1904,&mdash;the teaching
of agriculture had from the beginning been an important part
of the university&rsquo;s work,&mdash;with an agricultural experiment
station, established in 1887 by the Federal government; the
college of architecture (133 students); the college of civil engineering
(569 students); and the Sibley College of mechanical engineering
and mechanic arts (1163 students), named in honour of Hiram
Sibley (1807-1888), a banker of Rochester, N.Y., who gave
$180,000 for its endowment and equipment and whose son
Hiram W. Sibley gave $130,000 to the college. A state college
of forestry was established in connexion with the university in
1898, but was discontinued after several years. The total
enrolment of regular students in 1909 was 3980; in addition,
841 students were enrolled in the 1908 summer session (which
is especially for teachers) and 364 in the &ldquo;short winter course
in agriculture&rdquo; in 1909. Nearly all the states and territories
of the United States and thirty-two foreign countries were
represented&mdash;e.g. there were 33 students from China, 12 from
the Argentine Republic, 6 from India, 10 from Japan, 10 from
Mexico, 5 from Peru, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the W. central part of the campus is the university library
building, which, with an endowment (1891) of $300,000 for the
purchase of books and periodicals, was the gift of Henry Williams
Sage (1814-1897), second president of the board of trustees;
in 1906 it received an additional endowment fund of about
$500,000 by the bequest of Prof. Willard Fiske. The building,
of light grey Ohio sandstone, houses the general library (300,050
volumes in 1909), the seminary and department libraries (7284
volumes), and the forestry library (1007 volumes). Among the
special collections of the general library are the classical library
of Charles Anthon, the philological library of Franz Bopp, the
Goldwin Smith library (1869), the White architectural and
historical libraries, the Spinoza collection presented by Andrew
D. White (1894), the library of Jared Sparks, the Samuel J. May
collection of works on the history of slavery, the Zarncke library,
especially rich in Germanic philology and literature, the Eugene
Schuyler collection of Slavic folk-lore, literature and history, the
Willard Fiske Rhaeto-Romanic, Icelandic, Dante and Petrarch
collections, and the Herbert H. Smith collection of works on
Latin America (in addition there are college and department
libraries&mdash;that of the college of law numbers 38,735 volumes&mdash;bringing
the total to 353,638 bound volumes in 1909). Among
the other buildings are: Morse Hall, Franklin Hall, Sibley
College, Lincoln Hall (housing the college of civil engineering),
Goldwin Smith Hall (for language and history), Stimson Hall
(given by Dean Sage to the medical college), Boardman Hall
(housing the college of law), Morrill Hall (containing the psychological
laboratory), McGraw Hall and White Hall&mdash;these, with
the library, forming the quadrangle; S. of the quadrangle,
Sage chapel (with beautiful interior decorations), Barnes Hall
(the home of the Cornell University Christian Association),
Sage College (a dormitory for women), and the armoury and
gymnasium; E. of the quadrangle, the Rockefeller Hall of Physics
(1906) and the New York State College of Agriculture (completed
in 1907); and S.E. of the quadrangle the New York State
Veterinary College and the Fuertes Observatory. The university
is well-equipped with laboratories, the psychological laboratory,
the laboratories of Sibley college and the hydraulic laboratory
of the college of civil engineering being especially noteworthy;
the last is on Fall Creek, where a curved concrete masonry dam
has been built, forming Beebe Lake. East of the campus is
the university playground and athletic field (55 acres), built
with funds raised from the alumni. Cayuga Lake furnishes
opportunity for rowing, and the Cornell crews are famous.
During their first two years all undergraduates, unless properly
excused, must take a prescribed amount of physical exercise.
Normally the first year&rsquo;s exercise for male students is military
drill under the direction of a U.S. army officer detailed as commandant.</p>

<p>The reputation of the university is particularly high in
mechanical engineering; Sibley college was built up primarily
under Prof. Robert Henry Thurston (1839-1903), a well-known
engineer, its director in 1885-1903. The college includes the
following departments: machine design and construction,
experimental engineering, power engineering, and electrical
engineering. The &ldquo;Susan Linn Sage School of Philosophy,&rdquo;
so called since the gift (1891) of $200,000 from Henry W. Sage
in memory of his wife, issues <i>The Philosophical Review</i> and <i>Cornell
Studies in Philosophy</i>, and is well known for the psychological
laboratory investigations under Prof. E. B. Titchener (b. 1867).
Equally well known are the college of agriculture under Prof.
Liberty Hyde Bailey (b. 1858); the &ldquo;Cornell School&rdquo; of Latin
grammarians, led first by Prof. W. G. Hale and then by Prof.
C. E. Bennett; the department of entomology under Prof.
J. H. Comstock (b. 1849), the department of physics under
Prof. E. L. Nichols (b. 1854), and other departments. The university
publishes <i>Cornell Studies in Classical Philology</i>, the <i>Journal
of Physical Chemistry</i>, the <i>Physical Review</i>, <i>Publications of Cornell
University Medical College</i>, various publications of the college of
agriculture, and <i>Studies in History and Political Science</i> (of
&ldquo;The President White School of History and Political Science&rdquo;).
Among the student publications are <i>The Cornell Era</i> (1868,
weekly), <i>The Cornell Daily Sun</i> (1880), <i>The Sibley Journal of
Engineering</i> (1882), <i>The Cornell Magazine</i>, a literary monthly,
and <i>The Cornell Widow</i> (1892), a comic tri-weekly. The regular
annual tuition fee is $100, but in medicine, in architecture, and in
civil and mechanical engineering it is $150. In the veterinary
and agricultural colleges there are no tuition fees for residents of
New York state. There are 150 free-tuition state scholarships
(one for each of the state assembly districts), and, in addition,
there are 36 undergraduate university scholarships (annual
value, $200) tenable for two years, and 23 fellowships and 17
graduate scholarships (annual value, $300-600 each). In the
college of arts and sciences the elective system, with certain
restrictions, obtains.</p>

<p>The university has always been absolutely non-sectarian;
its charter prescribes that &ldquo;persons of every religious denomination,
or of no religious denomination, shall be equally eligible to
all offices and appointments&rdquo; and that &ldquo;at no time shall a
majority of the board (of trustees) be of one religious sect or of no
religious sect.&rdquo; There is, however, an active Christian Association
and religious services&mdash;provided for by the Dean Sage Preachership
Endowment&mdash;are conducted in Sage chapel by eminent clergymen
representing various sects and denominations.</p>

<p>The affairs of Cornell university are under the administration
of a board which must consist of forty trustees, of whom ten
are elected by the alumni. The following are <i>ex officio</i> members
of the board: the president of the university, the librarian of
the Cornell Library (in Ithaca), the governor and the lieutenant-governor
of the state, the speaker of the state assembly, the state
commissioners of education and of agriculture, and the president
of the state agricultural society. The internal government is
in the hands of the university faculty (which consists of the
president, the professors and the assistant professors, and has
jurisdiction over matters concerning the university as a whole),
and of the special faculties, which consist of the president, the
professors, the assistant professors, and the instructors of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
the several colleges, and which have jurisdiction over distinctively
collegiate matters.</p>

<p>In 1909 the invested funds of the university amounted to about
$8,594,300, yielding an annual income of about $428,800; the
income from state and nation was about $232,050, and from
tuition fees about $336,100; the campus and buildings were
valued at about $4,263,400, and the Library, collections,
apparatus, &amp;c. at about $1,826,100.</p>

<p>The university was incorporated by the legislature of New
York state on the 27th of April 1865, and was named in honour
of Ezra Cornell,<a name="FnAnchor_1f" id="FnAnchor_1f" href="#Footnote_1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> its principal benefactor. In 1864 Cornell, at
the suggestion of Andrew D. White, his fellow member of the
state senate, decided to found a university of a new type&mdash;which
should be broad and liberal in its scope, should be absolutely non-sectarian,
and which should recognize and meet the growing
need for practical training and adequate instruction in the
sciences as well as in the humanities. He offered to the state
as an endowment $500,000 (with 200 acres of land) on condition
that the state add to this fund the proceeds of the sales of public
lands granted to it by the Morrill Act of 1862 for &ldquo;the endowment,
support and maintenance of at least one college, where
the leading object shall be ... to teach such branches of learning
as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts.... &ldquo;<a name="FnAnchor_2f" id="FnAnchor_2f" href="#Footnote_2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
The charter provided that &ldquo;such other branches of science
and knowledge may be embraced in the plan of instruction
and investigation pertaining to the university as the trustees
may deem useful and proper,&rdquo; and Ezra Cornell expressed
his own ideal in the oft-quoted words: &ldquo;I would found an institution
where any person can find instruction in any study.&rdquo;
The opposition to Cornell&rsquo;s plan was bitter, especially on the part
of denominational schools and press, but incorporation was
secured, and the trustees first met on the 5th of September 1865.
Andrew D. White was elected president and the entire educational
scheme was left to him. Dr White&rsquo;s ideals in part were: a closer
union between the advanced and the general educational system
of the state; liberal instruction of the industrial classes;
increased stress on technical instruction; unsectarian control;
&ldquo;a course in history and political and social science adapted to
the practical needs of men worthily ambitious in public affairs&rdquo;;
a more thorough study of modern languages and literatures,
especially English; the &ldquo;steady effort to abolish monastic
government and pedantic instruction&rdquo;; the elective system of
studies; and the stimulus of non-resident lecturers. On the
7th of October 1868 the Cornell University opened with some
confusion due to the condition of the campus, and to the presence
of 412 would-be pupils, many of whom expected to &ldquo;work their
way through.&rdquo; The brilliance of the faculty and especially of its
non-resident members (including J. R. Lowell, Louis Agassiz,
G. W. Curtis, Bayard Taylor, Theodore D. Dwight, and Goldwin
Smith, who was a resident professor in 1866-1869), was to a
degree over-shadowed during the fifteen years 1868-1882 by
financial difficulties. But Ezra Cornell himself paid many
salaries during early years, and provided much valuable equipment
solely at his own expense; and because the state&rsquo;s land
scrip was selling too low to secure an adequate endowment for
the University, in 1866 he bought the land scrip yet unsold
(819,920 acres)<a name="FnAnchor_3f" id="FnAnchor_3f" href="#Footnote_3f"><span class="sp">3</span></a> by the state at the rate of sixty cents an acre
on the understanding that all profits, in excess of the purchase
money, should constitute a separate endowment fund to which
the restrictions in the Morrill Act should not apply; and in
1866-1867 he &ldquo;located&rdquo; 512,000 acres in Wisconsin, Minnesota,
and Kansas. In November 1874 he transferred these lands,
which had cost him $576,953 more than he had received from
them, to the university. This actual deficit on the lands
owned by the university steadily increased up to 1881, when,
after the trustees had refused (in 1880) an offer of $1,250,000
for 275,000 acres of pine lands, they sold about 140,600 acres
for $2,319,296; ultimately 401,296 acres of the land turned
over to the university by Cornell were sold, bringing a net
return of about $4,800,000. The university was put on a
sound financial footing; the number of students, less in 1881-1882
than in 1868 at the opening of the university, again
increased, so that it was 585 in 1884-1885, and 2120 in 1897-1898.
The presidents of the university have been: Andrew
Dickson White, 1865-1885; Charles Kendall Adams, 1885-1892;
and Jacob Gould Schurman.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1f" id="Footnote_1f" href="#FnAnchor_1f"><span class="fn">1</span></a> Ezra Cornell (1807-1874) was born in Westchester county, New
York, on the 11th of January 1807. His parents were Quakers
from Massachusetts. He received a scanty education; worked as a
carpenter in Syracuse and as a machinist in Ithaca; became interested
(about 1842) in the development of the electric telegraph; and after
unsuccessful or over-expensive attempts to ground the telegraph

<p><span class="bold">CORNET,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> a word having two distinct significations and two
etymological histories, both, however, ultimately referable to
the same Latin origin:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. (Fr. <i>cornette</i>, dim. of <i>corne</i>, from Lat. <i>cornu</i>, a horn), a
small standard, formerly carried by a troop of cavalry, and
similar to the pennon in form, narrowing gradually to a point.
The term was then applied to the body of cavalry which carried
a cornet. In this sense it is used in the military literature of the
16th century and, less frequently, in that of the 17th. Before
the close of the 16th century, however, the world had also come
to mean a junior officer of a troop of cavalry who, like the
&ldquo;ensign&rdquo; of foot, carried the colour. The spelling &ldquo;coronet&rdquo;
occurs in the 16th century, and has perhaps contributed to
obscure the derivation of &ldquo;colonel&rdquo; or &ldquo;coronel.&rdquo; The rank
of &ldquo;cornet&rdquo; remained in the British cavalry until the general
adoption of the term &ldquo;second lieutenant.&rdquo; In the Boer republics
&ldquo;field-cornets&rdquo; were local subordinate officers of the commando
(q.v.), the unit of the military forces. Elected for three years by
the wards into which the electoral districts were divided, they
had administrative as well as military duties, and acted as
magistrates, inspectors of natives and registration officers for
their respective wards. In 1907, the &ldquo;field-cornet&rdquo; system
was re-established in the Transvaal; the new duties of the
&ldquo;field-cornets&rdquo; are those performed by assistant magistrates,
viz. petty jurisdiction, registration of voters, births and deaths,
the carrying out of regulations as to animal diseases, and maintenance
of roads. The &ldquo;field-cornets&rdquo; are appointed by government
for three years.</p>

<p>2. (Fr. <i>cornet</i>, Ital. <i>cornetto</i>, Med. Lat. <i>cornetum</i>, a bugle, from
Lat. <i>cornu</i>, a horn), in music, the name of two varieties of wind
instruments (see below), and also of certain stops of the organ.
The great organ &ldquo;solo cornet&rdquo; was a mixture or compound stop,
having either 5, 4, or 3 ranges of pipes; occasionally it was
placed on a separate soundboard, when it was known as a
&ldquo;mounted cornet.&rdquo; The &ldquo;echo cornet&rdquo; was a similar stop, but
softer and enclosed in a box. In German and Dutch organs the
term cornet is sometimes applied to a pedal reed stop.</p>

<p>(a) <span class="sc">Cornet</span> or <span class="sc">Cornett</span> (Fr. <i>cornet</i>, <i>cornet à bouquin</i>; Ger.
<i>Zinck</i>, <i>Zincken</i>; Ital. <i>cornetto</i>) is the name given to a family of
wood wind instruments, now obsolete, having a cup-shaped
mouthpiece and a conical bore without a bell, and differing
entirely from the modern cornet à pistons. The old cornets
were of two kinds, the straight and the curved, characterized
by radical differences in construction. There were two very
different kinds of straight cornets (Ger. <i>gerader Zinck</i>, Ital.
<i>cornetto diretto</i> or <i>recto</i>), the one most commonly used having a
detachable cup-shaped mouthpiece similar to that of the trumpet,
while the other was made to all appearance without mouthpiece,
there being not even a moulded rim at the end of the tube to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
break the rigid straight line. Examination of the tube, however,
reveals the secret of the characteristic sweet tone of this latter
kind of cornet; unsuspected inside the top of the tube is cut out
of the thickness of the wood a mouthpiece, not cup-shaped, but
like a funnel similar to that of the French horn, which merges
gradually into the bore of the instrument. This mode of construction,
together with the narrower bore adopted, greatly
influenced the timbre of the instrument, whose softer tone was
thus due mainly to the substitution of the funnel for the sharp
angle of incidence at the bottom of the cup mouthpiece known
as the throat (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mouthpiece</a></span>), where it communicates with the
tube. It is this sharp angle, which in the other cornets with
detachable mouthpiece, causes the column of air to break,
producing a shrill quality of tone, while the wider bore and
slightly rough walls of the tube account for the harshness. In
Germany the sweet-toned cornet was known as <i>stiller</i> or <i>sanfter
Zinck</i>, and in Italy as <i>cornetto muto</i> (fig. 1), while in France the
instruments with detachable mouthpiece were distinguished
by the <span class="correction" title="amended from adition">addition</span> of <i>à bouquin</i> (= with mouthpiece).
The curved cornet (Ger. <i>krummer
Zinck</i> or <i>Stadtkalb</i>; Ital. <i>cornetto curvo</i>) could
not for obvious reasons have the bore pierced
through a single piece of
wood; the channel for
the vibrating column of air
was, therefore, hollowed
out of two pieces of wood,
the diameter increasing
from the mouthpiece to
the lower end. The two
pieces of wood thus prepared
were joined together
with glue and covered
with leather, the outer
surface of the tube being
finished off in octagonal
shape. The separate
mouthpiece, made indifferently
of wood, horn,
ivory or metal,<a name="FnAnchor_1g" id="FnAnchor_1g" href="#Footnote_1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> analogous
to that of the trumpet,
was distinctly cup-shaped
and fixed by a tenon to
the upper extremity of
the pipe. The primitive
instrument was an
animal&rsquo;s horn.</p>

<p>Pipes of such short
length give only, besides
the first or fundamental,
the second and sometimes
the third note of the
harmonic series. Thus a
pipe that has for its fundamental
A will, if the pressure of breath and tension of the
lips be steadily increased, give the octave A and the twelfth E.
In order to connect the first and second harmonics diatonically,
the length of the pipe was progressively shortened by boring
lateral holes through the tube for the fingers to cover. The
successive opening of these holes furnished the instrumentalist
with the different intervals of the scale, six holes sufficing for
this purpose:</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img style="border:0; width:274px; height:60px"
     src="images/img171a1.jpg"
     alt="" />
</div>

<p class="noind">The fundamental was thus connected with its octave by all the
degrees of a diatonic scale, which became chromatic by the help
of cross-fingering and the greater or less tension of the lips
stretched as vibrating reeds across the opening of the mouthpiece.
This increased compass of twenty-seven notes obtained
by cross-fingering is very clearly shown in a table by Eisel.<a name="FnAnchor_2g" id="FnAnchor_2g" href="#Footnote_2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
The fingering was completed by a seventh hole, which had for its
object the production of the octave without the necessity of
closing all the holes in order to produce the second note of the
harmonic series. The first complete octave, thus obtained by a
succession of fundamental notes, was easily octaved by a stronger
pressure of breath and tension of the lips across the mouthpiece,
and thus the ordinary limits of the compass of a <i>Zinck</i> or cornet
could be extended to a fifteenth. Whether straight or curved
it was pierced laterally with seven holes, six through the front,
and the seventh, that nearest the mouthpiece, through the back.
The first three holes were usually covered with the third, second
and first fingers of the right hand, the next four with the third,
second and first fingers and the thumb of the left hand. But
some instrumentalists inverted the position of the hands.
Virdung<a name="FnAnchor_3g" id="FnAnchor_3g" href="#Footnote_3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a> shows, besides the <i>cornetto recto</i>, a kind of <i>Zinck</i> made
of an animal&rsquo;s horn with only four holes, three in the front of
the pipe and one at the back. Such an instrument as this had
naturally a very limited compass, since these four holes only
sufficed to produce the intermediate notes between the second
and third proper tones of the harmonic scale, the lower octave
comprised between the first and second remaining incomplete;
by overblowing, however, the next octave would be obtained
in addition.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>At the beginning of the 17th century Praetorius<a name="FnAnchor_4g" id="FnAnchor_4g" href="#Footnote_4g"><span class="sp">4</span></a> represents the
<i>Zincken</i> as a complete family comprising: (1) the little <i>Zinck</i> with
the lowest note <img style="width:82px; height:41px" src="images/img171b.jpg" alt="" />, (2) the ordinary <i>Zinck</i> with the lowest
note <img style="width:81px; height:50px" src="images/img171c.jpg" alt="" />, (3) the great <i>Zinck</i>, <i>cornon</i> or <i>corno torto</i>, a great
cornet in the shape of an <img style="width:13px; height:17px" src="images/img171c1.jpg" alt="" /> with the lowest note <img style="width:120px; height:31px" src="images/img171d.jpg" alt="" />. In
France<a name="FnAnchor_5g" id="FnAnchor_5g" href="#Footnote_5g"><span class="sp">5</span></a> the family was composed of the following instruments:</p>

<p>(1) The <i>dessus</i> or treble cornet with the lowest note <img style="width:80px; height:50px" src="images/img171e.jpg" alt="" />;</p>

<p>(2) the <i>haute-contre</i> or alto cornet with the lowest note <img style="width:80px; height:51px" src="images/img171f.jpg" alt="" />;</p>

<p>(3) the <i>taille</i> or tenor cornet with the lowest note <img style="width:77px; height:32px" src="images/img171g.jpg" alt="" /> and the
<i>basse</i> or bass or <i>pédalle</i><a name="FnAnchor_6g" id="FnAnchor_6g" href="#Footnote_6g"><span class="sp">6</span></a> cornet with the lowest note <img style="width:74px; height:35px" src="images/img171h.jpg" alt="" />.</p>

<p class="noind">The cornets of the lowest pitch were sometimes furnished with an
open key which, when closed, lengthened the tube, and extended
the compass downwards by a note. Mersenne figures a <i>cornon</i> with
a key.</p>

<p>During the middle ages these instruments were in such favour
that an important part was given to them in all instrumental combinations.
At Dresden,<a name="FnAnchor_7g" id="FnAnchor_7g" href="#Footnote_7g"><span class="sp">7</span></a> between 1647 and 1651, the Kapelle of the
electoral prince of Saxony included two cornets, the bass being
supplied by the trombone. Monteverde introduced two cornets in
the 3rd and 4th acts of his <i>Orfeo</i> (1607). In France the charges for
the <i>Chapelle-Musique</i> of the kings of France for the year 1619 contain
two entries of the sum of 450 <i>livres tournois</i>, salary paid to one Marcel
Cayty, <i>joueur de cornet</i>, a post held by him from 1604 until at least
1631, when another cornet player, Jean Daneau, is also mentioned.<a name="FnAnchor_8g" id="FnAnchor_8g" href="#Footnote_8g"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>In Germany in the 17th and 18th centuries, <i>Zincken</i> were used
with trombones in the churches to accompany the chorales. There
are examples of this use of the instrument in the sacred cantatas
of J. S. Bach, where the cornet is added to the upper voice parts
to strengthen them. Johann Mattheson, conductor of the opera at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
Hamburg, writing on the orchestra in 1713<a name="FnAnchor_9g" id="FnAnchor_9g" href="#Footnote_9g"><span class="sp">9</span></a> gives a description of
the <i>Zinck</i> as a member of the orchestra, but in 1739,<a name="FnAnchor_10g" id="FnAnchor_10g" href="#Footnote_10g"><span class="sp">10</span></a> in his work
on the perfect conductor, he deplores the decrease of its popularity
in church music, from which it seems to be banished as useless.
Gluck was the last composer of importance who scored for the cornet,
as for instance in <i>Orfeo</i>, in <i>Paride ed Elena</i>, in <i>Alceste</i> and in <i>Armide</i>,
&amp;c. The great vogue of the curved cornet is not to be accounted for
by its musical qualities, for it had a hard, hoarse, piercing sound,
and it failed utterly in truth of intonation; these natural defects,
moreover, could only be modified with great difficulty. Mersenne&rsquo;s
eulogium of the <i>dessus</i>, then more employed than the other cornets,
can only be appreciated at its full value if we look upon the art of
cornet playing as a lost art. &ldquo;The <i>dessus</i>,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was used
in the vocal concerts and to make the treble with the organ, which
is ravishing when one knows how to play it to perfection like the
Sieur Guiclet;&rdquo; and again further on, &ldquo;the character of its tone
resembles the brilliance of a sunbeam piercing the darkness, when it is
heard among the voices in churches, cathedrals or chapels.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_11g" id="FnAnchor_11g" href="#Footnote_11g"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
Mersenne further observes that the serpent is the true bass of the
cornet, that one without the other is like body without soul.
A drawing in pen and ink of a curved cornet is given by Randle
Holme in his <i>Academy of Armoury</i> (1688);<a name="FnAnchor_12g" id="FnAnchor_12g" href="#Footnote_12g"><span class="sp">12</span></a> and at the end of the
description of the instrument he adds, &ldquo;It is a delicate pleasant wind
musick, if well played and humoured.&rdquo; Giovanni Maria Artusi<a name="FnAnchor_13g" id="FnAnchor_13g" href="#Footnote_13g"><span class="sp">13</span></a> of
Bologna, writing at the end of the 16th century, devotes much
space to the cornet, explaining in detail the three kinds of tonguing
used with the instrument. By tonguing is understood a method of
articulation into the mouthpiece of flute, cornet à pistons or trumpet,
of certain syllables which add brilliance to the tone. Artusi advocates
(1) for the guttural effect, <i>ler, ler, ler, der, ler, der, ler</i>; <i>ter, ler, ter</i>;
<i>ler, ter, ler</i>; (2) for the tongue effect, <i>tere, tere, tere</i>; (3) for the dental
effect, <i>teche, teche, teche</i>, used by those who wish to strike terror into
the hearts of the hearers&mdash;an effect, however, which offends the ear.
A clue to the popularity of the instrument during the middle ages
may perhaps be found in Artusi&rsquo;s remark that this instrument is
the most apt in imitating the human voice, but that it is very
difficult and fatiguing to play; the musician, he adds elsewhere,
should adopt an instrument to imitate the voice as much as possible,
such as the cornetto and the trombone. He mentions two players
in Venice, Il Cavaliero del Cornetto and M. Girolamo da Udine, who
excelled in the art of playing the cornet.</p>

<p>Being derived from the horn of an animal through which lateral
holes had been pierced, the curved cornet was probably the earlier,
and when the instrument came to be copied in metal and in wood
the straight cornet was the result of an attempt to simplify the
construction. The evolution probably took place in Asia Minor,
where tubes with conical bore were the rule, and the instrument was
thence introduced into Europe. A straight <i>Zinck</i>, having a grotesque
animal&rsquo;s head at the bell-end, and six holes visible, is pictured in a
miniature of the 11th century.<a name="FnAnchor_14g" id="FnAnchor_14g" href="#Footnote_14g"><span class="sp">14</span></a> What appears to be precisely the
same kind of instrument, although differing widely in reality, the
chaunter being reed-blown, is to be found in illuminated MSS. as the
chaunter of the bagpipe, as for example in a royal roll of Henry III.
at the British Museum,<a name="FnAnchor_15g" id="FnAnchor_15g" href="#Footnote_15g"><span class="sp">15</span></a> where it occurs twice played by a man on
stilts. The grotesque was probably added to the chaunter in imitation
of that on the straight <i>Zinck</i>. Two <i>stille Zincken</i> or <i>cornetti muti</i>
are among the musical instruments represented in the triumphal
procession of the emperor Maximilian I.<a name="FnAnchor_16g" id="FnAnchor_16g" href="#Footnote_16g"><span class="sp">16</span></a> (d. 1519), designed at his
command by H. Burgmair under the superintendence of Albrecht
Dürer.</p>
</div>

<p>(b) <span class="sc">Cornet à Pistons</span>, <span class="sc">Cornet</span>, <span class="sc">Cornopaean</span> (Fr. <i>cornet à
pistons</i>; Ger. <i>Cornett</i>; Ital. <i>cornetto</i>), are the names of a modern
brass wind instrument of the same pitch as the trumpet. Being
a transformation of the old post-horn, the cornet should have a
conical bore of wide diameter in proportion to the length of
tube, but in practice usually only a small portion of the tube
is conical, i.e. from the mouthpiece to the slide of the first valve
and from the slide of the third valve to the bell. The tube of
the cornet is doubled round upon itself. The cup-shaped mouthpiece
is larger than that of the trumpet; the shape of the cup
in conjunction with the length of the tube and the proportions
of the bore determines the timbre of the instrument. The outline
of the bottom of the cup, where it communicates with the bore,
is of the greatest importance.<a name="FnAnchor_17g" id="FnAnchor_17g" href="#Footnote_17g"><span class="sp">17</span></a> If, as in the trumpet, it presents
angles against which the column of air breaks, it produces a
brilliant tone quality. In the cornet mouthpiece there are no
angles at the bottom of the cup, which curves into the bore;
hence the cornet&rsquo;s loose, coarse quality of tone. The sound is
produced by stretching the lips across the mouthpiece, and
making them act as double reeds, set in vibration by the breath.
There are no fixed notes on the cornet as in instruments with
lateral holes, or with keys; the musical scale is obtained by means
of the power the performer possesses&mdash;once he has learned how
to use it&mdash;of producing the notes of the harmonic series by overblowing,
i.e. by varying the tension of the lips and the pressure
of breath. In the cornet this series is short, comprising only
the harmonics from the 2nd to the 8th:</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 300px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figleft1"><img style="width:245px; height:73px" src="images/img172a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p class="noind f90"><br /><br />Harmonic series of the B&#9837; cornet&mdash;the
7th is slightly flat, a defect
which the performer corrects, if he
uses the note at all.</p>

<p class="noind" style="clear: both;">The intermediate notes completing the chromatic scale are
obtained by means of three pistons which, on being depressed,
open valves leading into supplementary wind-ways, which
lengthen the original tube. The pitch of the instrument is thus
lowered respectively one tone, half a tone, and one tone and a
half. The action of the piston temporarily changes the key of
the instrument and with it the notes of the harmonic series.
Before a performer, therefore, can play a note he must know
in which harmonic series it is best obtained and use the proper
piston in conjunction with the requisite lip tension. By means
of the pistons the compass of the cornet is thus extended from</p>

<p class="noind f90"><br /><br /><br />(The minims indicate the practical
compass but the extension shown
by the crotchets is possible to all
good players.)</p>

<p class="noind" style="clear: both;">The treble clef is used in notation, and in England the music
for the cornet is usually written as sounded, but most French
and German composers score for it as for a transposing instrument;
for example, the music for the B&#9837; cornet is written in
a key one tone higher than that of the composition.</p>

<p>The <i>timbre</i> of the cornet lies somewhere between that of the
horn and the trumpet, having the blaring, penetrating quality
of the latter without its brilliant noble sonorousness. The great
favour with which the cornet meets is due to the facility with
which it speaks, to the little fatigue it causes, and to the simplicity
of its mechanism. We must, however, regret from the point
of view of art that its success has been so great, and that it has
ended in usurping in brass bands the place of the bugles, the
tone colour of which is infinitely preferable as a foundation for
an ensemble composed entirely of brass instruments. Even
the symphonic orchestra has not been secure from its intrusion,
and the growing tendency in some orchestras, notably in France,
to allow the cornet to supersede the trumpet, to the great detriment
of tone colour, is to be deplored. The cornet used in a
rich orchestral harmony is of value for completing the chords
of trumpets, or to undertake diatonic and chromatic passages
which on account of their rapidity cannot easily be fingered by
trombones or horns. The technical possibilities of the instrument
are very great, almost unrivalled in the brass wind:&mdash;notes
sustained, crescendo or diminuendo; diatonic and chromatic
scale and arpeggio passages; leaps, shakes, and in fact all kinds
of musical figures in any key, can be played with great facility
on the three-valved cornet. Double tonguing is also practicable,
the articulation with the tongue of the syllables <i>ti-ke</i> for
double, and of <i>ti-ke-ti</i> for triple time producing a striking staccato
effect.</p>

<p>The cornet was evolved in Germany, at the beginning of the
19th century, from the post-horn, by the application of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
newly invented pistons of Stoelzel and Bluemel patented in 1815.
It was introduced into Great Britain and France about 1830.
There were at first only two pistons&mdash;for a whole tone and for
a half tone&mdash;from which there naturally resulted gaps in the
chromatic scale of the instrument. The use of a combination
of pistons (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bombardon</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Valves</a></span>) fails to give acoustically
correct intervals, because the length of tubing thus thrown open
is not of the theoretical length required to produce the interval.
A tube about 4 ft. long, such as that of the B&#9837; cornet, needs an
additional length of about 3 in. to lower the pitch a semitone;
but, if this cornet has already been lowered one tone to the key
of A&#9837;, the length of tube has increased some 6 in., and the
3-in. semitone piston no longer adds sufficient tubing to
produce a semitone
of correct intonation.
To the performer
falls the task
of concealing the
shortcomings of his
instrument, and he
therefore corrects
the intonation by
varying the lip tension.
At first the
cornet was supplied
with a great many
crooks for A, A&#9837;, G, F, E, E&#9837; and D, but from the explanation
<span class="correction" title="omitted the word 'but' before now">now</span> given, it will be readily understood that they were
found unpractical for valve instruments, and all but the first
two mentioned have been abandoned. The history of the cornet
is a record of the endeavours of successive musical instrument
makers to overcome this inherent defect in construction. The
most ingenious and successful of these improvements are the
following:&mdash;(1) The <i>six-valve-independent system</i><a name="FnAnchor_18g" id="FnAnchor_18g" href="#Footnote_18g"><span class="sp">18</span></a> of Adolphe
Sax, designed about 1850, by which a separate valve was used
for each position, thus obviating the necessity of using combinations
of pistons. This theoretically perfect system unfortunately
introduced great difficulties in practice, the valves being made
<i>ascending</i> instead of <i>descending</i>, and each piston cutting off a
definite length of wind-way from the open tube, instead of adding
to it. The system was eventually abandoned. (2) The <i>Besson
Registre</i> giving eight independent positions, afterwards modified
as the (3) <i>Besson compensating system transpositeur</i>, patented
in England in 1859, which was considered so successful that the
idea was extensively used by other makers. (4) The <i>Boosey
automatic compensating piston</i>, invented by D. J. Blaikley, and
patented in 1878, a very ingenious device whereby when two
or more pistons are used simultaneously the length of the air
column is automatically adjusted to the theoretical length
required to ensure correct intonation. (5) Victor Mahillon&rsquo;s
automatic regulating pistons (<i>pistons régulateur automatique</i>)
produced about 1886, the result of independent efforts in the
same direction as Blaikley, and equally ingenious and effectual.<a name="FnAnchor_19g" id="FnAnchor_19g" href="#Footnote_19g"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
Finally we have (6) more recently the <i>Besson enharmonic valve
system</i> (fig. 3) with three pistons and six independent tuning
slides which give the seven positions independently, thus realizing
in a simple effectual manner all that Sax strove to accomplish
with his six pistons. The enharmonic valves give all notes
theoretically true; there are in addition separate means for
adjusting each of the first six lengths, for although these lengths
are theoretically correct there are always certain modifying
conditions connected with brass instruments which render it
essential to provide means for adjustment. All notes being true
on this Besson cornet, they can be fingered to the greatest
advantage for smoothness and rapidity. (7) Rudall, Carte &amp; Co.&rsquo;s
cornet (fig. 4), with strictly conical bore (Klussmann&rsquo;s patent)
throughout the open tube and additional lengths from the mouthpiece
to the bell, gives a perfect intonation and is at the same
time easy to blow. There are no crooks to this cornet when
constructed in B&#9837;, but it may be instantaneously transposed
into the key of A major by means of an undetachable slide
guided by a piston rod.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNETO TARQUINIA<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (anc. <i>Tarquinii</i>), a town of Italy,
in the province of Rome, 62 m. N.W. by rail from the town of
Rome, 490 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 5273. Corneto
probably arose after the ancient town had been destroyed by
the Saracens. In the 10th century it began to acquire importance,
and for some time was an independent commune. It is
picturesquely situated, and commands a fine view. It possesses
medieval fortifications, and no less than twenty-five towers are
still standing in various parts of the town, which thus has a
remarkably medieval appearance. The castle on the N. contains
the Romanesque church of S. Maria in Castello, begun in 1121,
with a fine portal of 1143, a <i>ciborium</i> of 1168 and a pulpit of
1209, both in &ldquo;cosmatesque&rdquo; work: the pavement in marble
mosaic also is fine. There are several other Romanesque and
Gothic churches in the town more or less restored. The oldest
parts of the Palazzo Comunale date from about 1000. The
Gothic Palazzo Vitelleschi (1439) contains remarkably rich
windows. The municipal museum (which is to be transferred to
this palace) and the Palazzo Bruschi, contain fine collections
of Etruscan antiquities from the tombs of Tarquinii. Four
miles to the S.W. is the Porto Clementino (perhaps the ancient
<i>Graviscae</i>, the port of Tarquinii), with government saltworks,
in which convicts are employed.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORNIFICIUS,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> the author of a work on rhetorical figures,
and perhaps of a general treatise (<i>ars</i>, <span class="grk" title="technê">&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951;</span>) on the art of
rhetoric (Quintilian, <i>Instit.</i>, iii. 1. 21, ix. 3. 89). He has been
identified with the author of the four books of <i>Rhetorica</i> dedicated
to a certain Q. Herennius and generally known under the title
of <i>Auctor ad Herennium</i>. The chief argument in favour of this
identity is the fact that many passages quoted by Quintilian
from Cornificius are reproduced in the <i>Rhetorica</i>. Jerome,
Priscian and others attributed the work to Cicero (whose <i>De
inventione</i> was called <i>Rhetorica prima</i>, the <i>Auctor ad Herennium</i>,
<i>Rhetorica secunda</i>), while the claims of L. Aelius Stilo, M. Antonius
Gnipho, and Ateius Praetextatus to the authorship have been
supported by modern scholars. But it seems improbable that
the question of authorship will ever be satisfactorily settled.
Internal indications point to the date of compositions as 86-82
B.C., the period of Marian domination in Rome. The unknown
author, as may be inferred from the treatise itself, did not write
to make money, but to oblige his relative and friend Herennius,
for whose instruction he promises to supply other works on
grammar, military matters and political administration. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
expresses his contempt for the ordinary school rhetorician, the
hair-splitting dialecticians and their &ldquo;sense of inability to speak,
since they dare not even pronounce their own name for fear of
expressing themselves ambiguously.&rdquo; Finally, he admits that
rhetoric is not the highest accomplishment, and that philosophy
is far more deserving of attention. Politically, it is evident that
he was a staunch supporter of the popular party.</p>

<p>The first and second books of the <i>Rhetorica</i> treat of <i>inventio</i>
and forensic rhetoric; the third, of <i>dispositio</i>, <i>pronuntiatio</i>,
<i>memoria</i>, deliberative and demonstrative rhetoric; the fourth,
of <i>elocutio</i>. The chief aims of the author are conciseness and
clearness (<i>breviter et dilucide scribere</i>). In accordance with this,
he ignores all rhetorical subtleties, the useless and irrelevant
matter introduced by the Greeks to make the art appear more
difficult of acquisition; where possible, he uses Roman terminology
for technical terms, and supplies his own examples
of the various rhetorical figures. The work as a whole is considered
very valuable. The question of the relation of Cicero&rsquo;s
<i>De inventione</i> to the <i>Rhetorica</i> has been much discussed. Three
views were held: that the Auctor copied from Cicero; that they
were independent of each other, parallelisms being due to their
having been taught by the same rhetorician at Rome; that
Cicero made extracts from the <i>Rhetorica</i>, as well as from other
authorities, in his usual eclectic fashion. The latest editor,
F. Marx, puts forward the theory that Cicero and the Auctor have
not produced original works, but have merely given the substance
of two <span class="grk" title="technai">&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> (both emanating from the Rhodian school); that
neither used the <span class="grk" title="technai">&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> directly, but reproduced the revised
version of the rhetoricians whose school they attended, the
introductions alone being their own work; that the lectures on
which the Ciceronian treatise was based were delivered before
the lectures attended by the Auctor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNING, ERASTUS<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (1794-1872), American capitalist, was
born in Norwich, Connecticut, on the 14th of December 1794.
In 1807 he became a clerk in a hardware store at Troy, New
York, but in 1814 he removed to Albany, where he eventually
became the owner of extensive ironworks, obtained a controlling
interest in various banking institutions, and accumulated a
large fortune. He was prominently connected with the early
history of railway development in New York, became president
of the Utica &amp; Schenectady line, and was the principal factor
in the extension and consolidation of the various independent
lines that formed the New York Central system, of which he
was president from 1853 to 1865. He was also interested in the
building of the Michigan Central and the Chicago, Burlington &amp;
Quincy railways, and was president of the company which
constructed the Sault Sainte Marie ship canal, providing a navigable
waterway between Lakes Huron and Superior. He was
prominent in politics as a Democrat, and, after serving as mayor
of Albany from 1834 to 1837, and as state senator from 1842 to
1845, he was a representative in Congress in 1857-1859 and in
1861-1863, being re-elected for a third term in 1862, but resigning
before the opening of the session. In 1861 he was a delegate
to the Peace Congress, but when the Civil War actually began
he loyally supported the Lincoln administration. He was a
delegate to the New York constitutional convention of 1867,
and was for many years vice-chancellor of the board of regents
of the University of the State of New York. He died at Albany,

buildings and institutions are a fine city hall, a Federal building,
a county court house, the Corning hospital, a free public library
and St Mary&rsquo;s orphan asylum (Roman Catholic). Corning is one
of the principal markets in New York state for tobacco, which
is extensively produced in the surrounding country. The
principal industry is the making of cut and flint glass, and, of
the several extensive plants devoted to this industry, that of
the Corning Glass Works is one of the largest in the world. The
city also has railway car shops and foundries, and among its
manufactures are pressed brick, tile and terra-cotta, papier-mâché
and lumber. The total value of the factory products in
1905 was $3,083,515, 35.7% more than in 1900. There were
settlers on the site of Corning as early as 1789, but it was not
until 1848 that it was incorporated as a village under its present

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORN LAWS.<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> In England, legislation on corn was early
applied both to home and foreign trade in this essential produce.
Roads were so bad, and the chain of home trade so feeble, that
there was often scarcity of grain in one part, and plenty in another
part of the same kingdom. Export by sea or river to some foreign
market was in many cases more easy than the carriage of corn
from one market to another within the country. The frequency
of local dearths, and the diversity and fluctuation of prices, were
thus extreme. It was out of this general situation that the first
corn laws arose, and they appear to have been wholly directed
towards lowering the price of corn. Exportation was prohibited,
and home merchandise in grain was in no repute or toleration.
As long as the rent of land, including the extensive domains of
the crown, was paid in kind, the sovereign, the barons and other
landholders had little interest in the price of corn different from
that of other classes of people, the only demand for corn being
for consumption and not for resale or export. But as rents
of land came to be paid in money, the interest of the farmer to
be distinguished by a remove from that of the landowner, the
difference between town and country to be developed, and the
business of society to be more complex, the ruling powers of the
state were likely to be actuated by other views; and hence the
force which corn legislation afterward assumed in favour of what
was deemed the agricultural interest. But during four centuries
after the Conquest the corn law of England simply was that
export of corn was prohibited, save in years of extreme plenty
under forms of state licence, and that producers carried their
surplus grain into the nearest market town, and sold it there
for what it would bring among those who wanted it to consume;
and the same rule prevailed in the principal countries of the
continent of Europe. This policy, though, as one may argue
from its long continuance, probably not felt to be acutely
oppressive, was of no avail in removing the evils against which
it was directed. On the contrary it prolonged and aggravated
them. The prohibition of export discouraged agricultural improvement,
and in so much diminished the security and liberality
even of domestic supply; while the intolerance of any home
dealing or merchandise in corn prevented the growth of a commercial
and financial interest strong enough to improve the means
of transport by which the plenty of one part of the same country
could have come to the aid of the scarcity in another.</p>

<p>Apart from this general feudal germ of legislation on corn,
the history of the British corn laws may be said to have begun
with the statute in the reign of Henry VI. (1436), by
which exportation was permitted without state licence,
<span class="sidenote">English corn laws, 1436-1603.</span>
when the price of wheat or other corn fell below certain
prices. The reason given in the preamble of the
statute was that the previous state of the law had compelled
farmers to sell their corn at low prices, which was no doubt true,
but which also showed the important turn of the tide that had
set in. J. R. M&lsquo;Culloch, in an elaborate article in the <i>Commercial
Dictionary</i>, says that the fluctuation of the prices of corn in that
age was so great, and beyond all present conception, that &ldquo;it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
not easy to determine whether the exportation price of 6s. 8d.
for wheat&rdquo; [12s. 10d. in present money per quarter] &ldquo;was above
or below the medium price.&rdquo; But while the medium price of
the kingdom must be held to be unascertainable in a remote
time, when the medium price in any principal market town of
England did not agree with that of another for any year or series
of years, one may readily perceive that the cultivators of the
wheat lands in the south-eastern counties of England, for example,
who could frequently have sold their produce in that age to
Dutch merchants to better advantage than in their own market
towns, or even in London, but were prohibited to export abroad,
and yet had no means of distributing their supplies at home so
as to realize the highest medium price in England, must have
felt aggrieved, and that their barons and knights of the shire
would have a common interest in making a strong effort to
rectify the injustice in parliament. This object appears to have
been in some measure accomplished by this statute, and twenty-seven
years afterwards (1463) a decided step was taken towards
securing to agriculturists a monopoly of the home market by a
statute prohibitory of importation from abroad. Foreign import
was to be permitted only at and above the point of prices where
the export of domestic produce was prohibited. The landed
interest had now adopted the idea of sustaining and equalizing
the value of corn, and promoting their own industry and gains,
which for four centuries, under various modifications of plan,
and great changes of social and political condition, were to
maintain a firm place in the legislation and policy of England.
But there were many reasons why this idea, when carried into
practice, should not have the results anticipated from it.</p>

<p>The import of grain from abroad, even in times of dearth and
high prices at home, could not be considerable as long as the
policy of neighbouring countries was to prohibit export; nor
could the export of native corn, even with the Dutch and other
European ports open to such supplies, be effective save in limited
maritime districts, as long as the internal corn trade was suppressed,
not only by want of roads, but by legal interdict. The
regulation of liberty of export and import by rates of price,
moreover, had the same practical objection as the various sliding-scales,
bounties, and other legislative expedients down to 1846,
viz. that they failed, probably more in that age than in later
times, to create a permanent market, and aimed only at a casual
trade. When foreign supplies were needed, they were often not
to be found; and when there was an excess of corn in the country
a profitable outlet was both difficult and uncertain. It would
appear, indeed, that during the Wars of the Roses the statutes
of Henry VI. and Edward IV. had become obsolete; for a law
regulating export prices in identical terms of the law of 1436
was re-enacted in the reign of Philip and Mary (1554). In the
preceding reign of Edward VI., as well as in the succeeding long
reign of Elizabeth, there were unceasing complaints of the decay
of tillage, the dearth of corn, and the privations of the labouring
classes; and these complaints were met by the same kind
of measures&mdash;by statutes encouraging tillage, forbidding the
enlargement of farms, imposing severer restrictions on storing
and buying and selling of grain, and by renewed attempts to
regulate export and import according to prices. In 1562 the
price at which export might take place was raised to 10s. per
quarter for wheat, and 6s. 8d. for barley and malt. This only
lasted a few years, and in 1570 the export of wheat and barley
was permitted from particular districts on payment of a duty
of 1s. 8d. per quarter, although still liable to prohibition by the
government or local authority, while it was entirely prohibited
under the old regulations from other districts. Only at the close
of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign (1603) did a spark of new light appear in a
further statute, which removed the futile provisions in favour
of tillage and against enlargement of pastoral farms, and rested
the whole policy for promoting an equable supply of corn, while
encouraging agriculture, on an allowed export of wheat and
other grain at a duty of 2s. and 1s. 4d. when the price of wheat
was not more than 20s., and of barley and malt 12s. per quarter.
The import of corn appears to have been much lost sight of from
the period of the statute of 1463. The internal state of England,
as well as the policy of other countries of Europe, was unfavourable
to any regular import of grain, though many parts of the
kingdom were often suffering from dearth of corn. It is obvious
that this legislation, carried over more than a century and a half,
failed of its purpose, and that it neither promoted agriculture
nor increased the supply of bread. So great a variance and
conflict between the intention of statutes and the actual course
of affairs might be deemed inexplicable, but for an explanation
which a close economic study of the circumstances of the times
affords.</p>

<p>Besides the general reasons of the failure already indicated,
there were three special causes in active operation, which, though
not seen at the period, have become distinct enough since. (1)
A comparatively free export of wool had been permitted in
England from time immemorial. It was subject neither to
conditions of price nor to duties in the times under consideration,
was easier of transport and much less liable to damage than corn,
and, under the extending manufactures of France and the Low
Countries, was sure of a foreign as well as a domestic market.
Here was one description of rural produce on which there was
the least embargo, and on which some reliance could be placed
that it would in all circumstances bring a fair value; while corn,
the prime rural produce, was subject as a commodity of merchandise
to every difficulty, internally and externally, which
meddling legislation and popular prejudice could impose. The
numerous statutes enjoining tillage and discouraging pastoral
farms&mdash;or in other words requiring that agriculturists should
turn from what was profitable to what was unprofitable&mdash;had
consequently no substantial effect, save in the many individual
instances in which the effect may have been injurious. (2) The
value of the standard money of the kingdom had been undergoing
great depreciation from two opposite quarters at once.
The pound sterling of England was reduced in weight of pure
metal from £1 : 18 : 9 in 1436, the date of the first of the corn
statutes, to 4s. 7¾d. in 1551, as far as can be estimated in present
money, and to £1 : 0 : 6¾ under the restoration of the coinage
in the following year. At the same time the greater abundance
of silver, which now began to be experienced in Europe from the
discovery of the South American mines, was steadily reducing
the intrinsic value of the metal. Hence a general rise of prices
remarked by Hume and other historians; and hence also it
followed that a price of corn fixed for export or import at one
period became always at another period more or less restrictive
of export than had been designed. (3) The wages of labour
would have followed the advance in the prices of commodities
had wages been left free, but they were kept down by statute
to the three or four pence per day at which they stood when
the pound sterling contained one-fourth more silver, and silver
itself was much more valuable. This was a refinement of
cruelty. The feudal system was breaking up; a wage-earning
population was rapidly increasing both in the farms and
in the towns; but the spirit of feudalism remained, and
the iron collar of serfdom was riveted round the necks of
the labourers by these statutes many generations after they had
become nominally freemen.<a name="FnAnchor_1h" id="FnAnchor_1h" href="#Footnote_1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The result was chronic privation
and discontent among the common people, by which all the
conditions of agriculture and trade in corn were further straitened
and barbarized; and an age, in some high respects among the
most brilliant in the annals of England, was marked by an
enormous increase of pauperism, and by the introduction of the
merciful but wasteful remedy of the Poor Laws.</p>

<p>The corn legislation of Elizabeth remained without change
during the reign of James, the civil wars and the Commonwealth.
But on the restoration of Charles II. in 1660, the question was
resumed, and an act was passed of a more prohibitory character.
<span class="sidenote">1660-1773.</span>
Export and import of corn, while nominally permitted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
were alike subjected to heavy duties&mdash;the need of the exchequer
being the paramount consideration, while the agriculturists were
no doubt pleased with the complete command secured
to them in the home market. This act was followed
by such high prices of corn, and so little advantage
to the revenue, that parliament in 1663 reduced the duties on
import to 9% <i>ad valorem</i>, while at the same time raising the
price at which export ceased to 48s., and reducing the duty
on export from 20s. to 5s. 4d. per quarter. In a few years
this was found to be too much free-trade for the agricultural
liking, and in 1670 prohibitory duties were re-imposed on import
when the home price was under 53s. 4d., and a duty of 8s.
between that price and 80s., with the usual make-weight in
favour of home supply, that export should be prohibited when
the price was 53s. 4d. and upwards. But complaints of the
decline of agriculture continued to be as rife under this act as
under the others, till on the accession of William and Mary, the
landed interest, taking advantage of the Revolution as they
had taken advantage of the Restoration to promote their own
interests, took the new and surprising step of enacting a bounty
on the export of grain. This evil continued to affect the corn
laws of the kingdom, varied, on one occasion at least, with the
further complication of bounties on import, until the 19th century.
The duties on export being abolished, while the heavy duties
on import were maintained, this is probably the most one-sided
form which the British corn laws ever assumed, but it was
attended with none of the advantages anticipated. The prices
of corn fell, instead of rising. There had occurred at the period
of the Revolution a depreciation of the money of the realm,
analogous in one respect to that which marked the first era of
the corn statutes (1436-1551), and forming one of the greatest
difficulties which the government of William had to encounter.
The coin of the realm was greatly debased, and as rapidly as
the mint sent out money of standard weight and purity, it was
melted down, and disappeared from the circulation. The influx
of silver from South America to Europe had spent its action on
prices before the middle of the century; the precious metals
had again hardened in value; and for forty years before the
Revolution the price of corn had been steadily falling in money
price. The liberty of exporting wool had also now been cut
down before the English manufactures were able to take up the
home supply, and agriculturists were consequently forced to
extend their tillage. When the current coin of the kingdom
became wholly debased by clipping and other knaveries, there
ensued both irregularity and inflation of nominal prices, and
the producers and consumers of corn found themselves equally
ill at ease. The farmers complained that the home-market for
their produce was unremunerative and unsatisfactory; the
masses of the people complained with no less reason that the
money wages of labour could not purchase them the usual
necessaries of life. Macaulay, in his <i>History of England</i>, says
of this period, with little exaggeration, that &ldquo;the price of the
necessaries of life, of shoes, of ale, of oatmeal, rose fast. The
labourer found that the bit of metal which, when he received it,
was called a shilling, would hardly, when he purchased a pot
of beer or a loaf of rye bread, go as far as sixpence.&rdquo; The state
of agriculture could not be prosperous under these conditions.
But when the government of William surmounted this difficulty
of the coinage, as they did surmount it, under the guidance of
Sir Isaac Newton, with remarkable statesmanship, it necessarily
followed that prices, so far from rising, declined, because, for one
reason, they were now denominated in a solid metallic value.
The rise of prices of corn attending the first years of the export
bounty was consequently of very brief duration. The average
price of wheat in the Winchester market, which in the ten years
1600-1699 was £2: 10s., fell in the ten years 1716-1725 to
£1 : 5 : 4, and in the ten years 1746-1755 to £1 : 1 : 2¾. The
system of corn law established in the reign of William and Mary
was probably the most perfect to be conceived for advancing
the agricultural interest of any country. Every stroke of the
legislature seemed complete to this end. Yet it wholly failed
of its purpose. The price of wheat again rose in 1750-1760 and
1760-1770 to £1 : 19 : 3¼ and £2 : 11 : 3¾, but many causes
had meanwhile been at work, as invariably happens in such
economic developments, the operation of which no statutes
could embrace, either to control or to prevent. Between the
reign of William and Mary and that of George III., the question
of bounty on export of grain had, in the general progress of the
country, fallen into the background, while that of the heavy
embargoes on import had come to the front. Therefore it is
that Burke&rsquo;s Act of 1773, as a deliberate attempt to bring the
corn laws into some degree of reason and order, is worthy of
special mention. This statute permitted the import of foreign
wheat at a nominal duty of 6d. when the home price was 48s.
per quarter, and it stopped both the liberty to export and the
bounty on export together when the home price was 44s. per
quarter. The one blemish of this statute was the stopping
export and cutting off bounty on export at the same point of
price.</p>

<p>Few questions have been more discussed or more differently
interpreted than the elaborate system of corn laws dating from
the reign of William and Mary. So careful an observer as
Malthus was of opinion that the bounty on export had enlarged
the area of subsistence. That it had large operation is sufficiently
attested by the fact that, in the years from 1740 to 1751, bounties
were paid out of the exchequer to the amount of £1,515,000,
and in 1749 alone they amounted to £324,000. But the trade
thus forced was of no permanence, and the British exports of
corn, which reached a maximum of 1,667,778 quarters in 1749-1750,
had fallen to 600,000 quarters in 1760 and continued to
decrease.</p>

<p>Burke&rsquo;s Act lasted long enough to introduce a regular import
of foreign grain, varying with the abundance or scarcity of the
home harvest, yet establishing in the end a systematic
preponderance of imports over exports. The period,
<span class="sidenote">1791-1846.</span>
moreover, was marked by great agricultural improvements,
by extensive reclamation of waste lands, and by an
increased home produce of wheat, in the twenty years from
1773 to 1793, of nearly 2,000,000 quarters. Nor had the course
of prices been unsatisfactory. The average price of British
wheat in the twenty years was £2 : 6 : 3, and in only three
years of the twenty was the price a fraction under £2. But the
ideas in favour of greater freedom of trade, of which the act of
1773 was an indication, and of which another memorable example
was given in Pitt&rsquo;s commercial treaty with France, were overwhelmed
in the extraordinary excitement caused by the French
Revolution, and all the old corn law policy was destined to have
a sudden revival. The landowners and farmers complained that
an import of foreign grain at a nominal duty of 6d., when the
price of wheat was only 48s., deprived them of the ascending
scale of prices when it seemed due; and on this instigation an
act was passed in 1791, whereby the price at which importation
could proceed at the nominal duty of 6d. was raised to 54s., with
a duty of 2s. 6d. from 54s. to 50s., and at 50s. and under 50s. a
prohibitory duty of 24s. 3d. The bounty on export was maintained
by this act, but exportation was allowed without bounty
till the price reached 46s.; and the permission accorded by the
<span class="correction" title="amended from statue">statute</span> of 1773 to import foreign corn at any price, to be reexported
duty free, was modified by a warehouse duty of 2s. 6d.
in addition to the duties on import payable at the time of sale,
when the corn, instead of being re-exported, happened to be sold
for home consumption. The legislative vigilance in this <span class="correction" title="amended from statue">statute</span>
to prevent foreign bread from reaching the home consumer is
remarkable. There were deficient home harvests for some years
after 1791, particularly in 1795 and 1797, and parliament was
forced to the new expedient of granting high bounties on importation.
At this period the country was involved in a great
war; all the customary commercial relations were violently
disturbed; freight, insurance and other charges on import and
export were multiplied fivefold; heavier and heavier taxes were
imposed; and the capital resources of the kingdom were poured
with a prodigality without precedent into the war channels.
The consequence was that the price of corn, as of all other
commodities, rose greatly: and the Bank of England having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
stopped paying in specie in 1797, this raised nominal prices still
more under the liberal use of bank paper in loans and discounts,
and the difference that began to be established in the actual
value of Bank of England notes and their legal par in
bullion.</p>

<p>The average price of British wheat rose to £5 : 19 : 6 in 1801.
So unusual a value must have led to a large extension of the area
under wheat, and to much corn-growing on land that after great
outlay was ill prepared for it. In the following years there were
agricultural complaints; and in 1804, though in 1803 the average
price of wheat had been as high as £2 : 18 : 10, an act was
passed, so much more severe than any previous statute, that
its object would appear to have been to keep the price of corn
somewhere approaching the high range of 1801. A prohibitory
duty of 24s. 3d. was imposed on the import of foreign wheat
when the home price was 63s. or less; and the price at which
the bounty was paid on export was lowered to 40s., while the
price at which export might proceed without bounty was raised
to 54s. Judging from the prices that ruled during the remaining
period of the French wars, this statute would appear to have
been effective for its end, though, under all the varied action
of the times on a rise of prices, it would be difficult to assign its
proper place in the general effect. The average price of wheat
rose to £4 : 9 : 9 in 1805, and the bank paper price in 1812
was as high even as £6 : 6 : 6. The bullion prices from 1809
to 1813 ranged from 86s. 6d. to 100s. 3d. But it was foreseen
that when the wars ended a serious reaction would ensue, and
that the rents of land, and the general condition of agriculture,
under the warlike, protective and monetary stimulation they had
received, would be imperilled. In the brief peace of 1814 the
average bullion price of British wheat fell to 55s. 8d. All the
means of select committees of inquiry on agricultural distress,
and new modifications of the corn laws, were again brought into
requisition. The first idea broached in parliament was to raise
the duties on foreign imports, as well as the prices at which they
were to be leviable, and to abolish the bounty on export, while
permitting freedom of export whatever the home price might
be. The latter part of the scheme was passed into law in the
session of 1814; but the irritation of the manufacturing districts
against the new scale of import duties was too great to be
resisted. In the subsequent session an act was passed, after much
opposition, fixing 80s. (14s. more than during the wars) as the
price at which import of wheat was to become free of duty.</p>

<p>This act of 1815 was intended to keep the price of wheat in the
British markets at about 80s. per quarter; but the era of war and
great expenditure of money raised by public loans had ended, the
ports of the continent were again open to some measure of trade
and to the equalizing effect of trade upon prices, the Bank of
England and other banks of issue had to begin the uphill course of
a resumption of specie payments, the nation had to begin to feel
the whole naked weight of the war debt, and the idea of the
protectors of a high price of corn was proved by the event to be
an utter hallucination. The corn statutes of the next twenty
years, though occupying an enormous amount of time and
attention in the Houses of Parliament, may be briefly treated, for
they are simply a record of the impotence of legislation to maintain
the price of a commodity at a high point when all the natural
economic causes in operation are opposed to it. In 1822 a statute
was passed reducing the limit of prices at which importation
could proceed to 70s. for wheat, 35s. for barley, 25s. for oats;
but behind the apparent relaxation was a new scale of import
duties, by which foreign grain was subjected to heavy three-month
duties up to a price of 85s.,&mdash;17s. when wheat was 70s., 12s. when
between 70s. and 80s., and 10s. when 85s., showing the grasping
spirit of the would-be monopolizers of the home supply of corn,
and their reluctance to believe in a lower range of value for corn
as for all other commodities. This act never operated, for the
reason that, with the exception in some few instances of barley,
prices never were so high as its projectors had contemplated.
The corn trade had passed rapidly beyond reach of the statutes
by which it was to be so painfully controlled; and as there were
occasional seasons of scarcity, particularly in oats, the king in
council was authorized for several years to override the statutes,
and do whatever the public interests might require.</p>

<p>In 1827 Canning introduced a new system of duties, under
which there would have been a fixed duty of 1s. per quarter
when the price of wheat was at or above 70s., and an increased
duty of 2s. for every shilling the price fell below 69s.; but though
Canning&rsquo;s resolutions were adopted by a large majority in the
House of Commons, his death and the consequent change of
ministers involved the failure of his scheme of corn duties. In
the following year Charles Grant introduced another scale of
import duties on corn, by which the duty was to be 23s. when the
price was 64s., 16s. 8d. when the price was 69s., and only 1s.
when the price was 73s. or above 73s. per quarter; and this
became law the same year. This sliding scale was more objectionable,
as a basis of foreign corn trade, than that of Canning,
though not following so closely shilling by shilling the variation of
prices, because of the abrupt leaps it made in the amount of
duties leviable. For example, a merchant who ordered a shipment
of foreign wheat when the home price was 70s. and rising to
73s., instead of having a duty of 1s. to pay, should on a backward
drop of the home price to 69s. have 16s. 8d. of duty to pay. The
result was to introduce wide and incalculable elements of speculation
into all transactions in foreign corn. The prices during most
part of this period were under the range at which import was
practically prohibited. The average price of British wheat was
96s. 11d. in 1817, but from that point there was in succeeding
years a rapid and progressive decline, varied only by the results
of the domestic harvests, till in 1835 the average price of wheat
was 39s. 4d., of barley 29s. 11d. and oats 22s. The import of
foreign grain in these years consisted principally of a speculative
trade, under a privilege of warehousing accorded in the statute of
1773, and extended in subsequent acts, by which the grain might
be sold for home consumption on payment of the duties, or
re-exported free, as suited the interest of the holders.</p>

<p>The act of 1822 admitted corn of the British possessions in
North America under a favoured scale of duties, and in 1825 a
temporary act was passed, allowing the import of wheat from
these provinces at a fixed duty of 5s. per quarter, irrespective of
the home price, which, if maintained, would have given some
stability to the trade with Canada. The idea of a fixed duty on
all foreign grain, however, appears to have grown in favour from
about this period. It was included in the programme of import
duty reforms of the Whig government in 1841, and fell with its
propounders in the general election of that year. Sir Robert
Peel, on succeeding to office, and commencing his remarkable
career as a free-trade statesman, introduced and carried in 1842
a new sliding scale of duties somewhat better adjusted to the
current values. But public opinion by this time was changing,
and the prime minister, convinced, as he confessed, by the
arguments of Cobden and the Anti-Corn-Law League, and
stimulated into action by the failure of the potato crop in
Ireland, put an effectual end to the history of the corn laws by
the famous act of 1846. It was provided under this measure that
the maximum duty on foreign wheat was to be immediately
reduced to 10s. per quarter when the price was under 48s., to 5s.
on barley when the price was under 26s., and to 4s. on oats when
the price was under 18s., with lower duties as prices rose above
these figures; but the conclusive part of the enactment was that
in three years&mdash;on the 1st of February 1849&mdash;these duties were
to cease, and all foreign corn to be admitted at a duty of 1s. per
quarter, and all foreign meal and flour at a duty of 4½d. per cwt.&mdash;the
same nominal imposts which were conceded to grain and flour
of British possessions abroad from the date of the act. In 1869
even these nominal duties were abolished by Robert Lowe in a
Customs Duties Act. In 1902 a registration duty of 3d. per cwt.
was imposed on imported corn, and 5d. per cwt. on imported
flour, in the expectation that such a duty would broaden the
basis of taxation. The duty was, however, repealed the following
year. But a low duty on imported foreign corn was made an
essential part of the tariff reform scheme advocated by Mr. J.
Chamberlain (q.v.) from 1903 onwards.</p>

<p><i>Foreign Corn Laws.</i>&mdash;Freedom of export of corn from customs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
duties has become the general rule of nearly all foreign countries.
It is somewhat curious that Spain saw the advantage to her wheat-producing
<span class="sidenote">Spain.</span>
provinces of freedom of export of wheat as
early as 1820, and three years afterwards extended
this freedom to all &ldquo;fruits of the soil&rdquo; in Spain. The import
duty on wheat, as on other grain, has varied from time to time.
The tariff of 1882 fixed the duty at 2s. 3¼d. per cwt.; a law of
February 1895 raised the duty to 4s. 3¼d. per cwt., at which rate
it remained till 1898, when it was reduced to 2s. 5¼d., though in
this same year, that of the war with the United States, it was for
some three months suspended, owing to distress in the country.
In 1899 it was raised to 3s. 3d., and by a law of March 1904 fixed
at 6.00 pesetas per 100 kilos (2s. 5¼d. per cwt.) as long as the
average price of wheat in the markets of Castile does not fall
below 27.00 pesetas per 100 kilos (11s. per cwt.). The duty on
rye, oats, barley and maize is 1s. 9½d. per cwt. The duty on
flour varied from 3s. 4½d. per cwt. in 1882 to 7s. 0½d. in 1895; by
the law of March 1904 it was fixed at 4s. 0¾d. per cwt. The duty
on rice is 2s. 1¾d. per cwt. in the husk and 4s. 3¾d. not in the husk.
<span class="sidenote">Portugal.</span>
In Portugal the import duty on wheat was fixed by a
law of May 1888 at 20 reis per kilo (4s. 7d. per cwt.).
By a law of July 1889, as amended by laws of August 1891 and
July 1899, importation is prohibited except in the event of the
home-grown crop being insufficient, and even then permission is
confined to millers. The duty, in the event of permission to
import being accorded, is to be charged on a sliding scale intended
to keep the cost of wheat to the millers, including the duty, at
60 reis (3¼d.) per kilo (2.2 &#8468;s.). Maize is subject to a duty of
4s. 1½d. per cwt., and rye, oats and barley to one of 3s. 8d. per cwt.
By laws of July 1889 and August 1891 the importation of flour
was prohibited except in the event of a strike of the mill-hands,
and the duty was fixed at 6s. 2d. per cwt. Export and import of
<span class="sidenote">France.</span>
grain in France were prohibited down to the period of
the repeal of the British corn laws, save when prices
were below certain limits in the one case and above certain other
limits in the other. But export of grain and flour from France has
long been free of duty. On the other hand, import duties have
varied considerably. By a law of 1881, the duty on wheat was
fixed at 3d. per cwt.; this duty was raised in 1885 to 1s. 2¾d. per
cwt. and again in 1887 to 2s. 0½d. By a law of 1894 the duty was
fixed at 2s. 10¼d. per cwt. In 1898, owing to the sudden rise in
the price of corn occasioned by the war between Spain and the
United States, the duty was temporarily (the 4th of May to the
30th of June) suspended. By a law of 1873 free importation of
rye, barley, maize and oats was permitted, but by a law of 1885
a duty was fixed at 7¼d. per cwt., and this was subsequently (1887)
increased to 1s. 2¾d. In 1881 the duty on imported flour was as
low as 5¾d. per cwt., but this was increased successively by laws
of 1885, 1887, 1891 and 1892, and in 1894 was fixed at 4s. 5¾d. per
cwt. at the rate of extraction of 70% and over; 5s. 5¾d. at 70 to
60%; and 6s. 6d. at 60% and under. In Belgium both the
<span class="sidenote">Belgium.</span>
export and import of wheat, rye, barley and maize are
free of duty; so also were oats and flour. Since 1895,
however, there has been a duty of 1s. 2½d. on oats, and of 9¾d. on flour.
The policy of the Netherlands was, owing to the advantages
<span class="sidenote">Netherlands.</span>
possessed by its ports, long favourable to the import
and export of grain. But for some years prior to 1845
there was a moderate sliding scale of import duties,
and this gave place, on the ravages of the potato disease, to a low
fixed duty; since 1877, however, the importation of cereals and
<span class="sidenote">Italy.</span>
flour has been free. In Italy there are no duties on the
export of grain. The import duties show a progressive
increase. In 1878 the import duty on wheat was 6¾d. per cwt.;
this was increased to 1s. 2¾d. in 1888, and in 1894 to 3s. 0½d. As
in Spain and France, there was a temporary reduction and
suspension during 1898, on the Spanish-American war. The
duty on rye, barley, oats and maize was fixed by the tariff of 1878
at 5½d. per cwt. By a decree of 1894 the duty on rye was raised
to 1s. 10d.; that on barley, by a decree of 1896, to 1s. 7½d.; that
on oats, by a decree of 1888, to 1s. 7½d.; and that on maize, by a
decree of 1896, to 3s. 0½d. The duty on flour, fixed at 1s. 1½d.,
by the tariff of 1878, was raised to 2s. 5¼d. in 1888, to 3s. 6½d. in
1888, and to 5s. in 1894. In Germany, the duty on wheat and
rye, as fixed by the tariff of 1879, was 6d. per cwt. In 1885 this
<span class="sidenote">Germany.</span>
was raised to 1s. 6¼d., and in 1888 to 2s. 6½d. By treaty
in 1892 this was decreased to 1s. 9¼d. On oats the
duty in 1879 was 6d. per cwt., increased to 9¼d. in 1885, and
again, in 1888, to 2s. 0½d., but reduced to 1s. 5d. in 1892. On
barley the duty in 1879 was 3d., in 1885 9¼d., in 1888 1s. 1¾d., and
in 1892 1s. 0¼d. On maize, 3d. in 1879, 6d. in 1885, 1s. 0¼d. in
1888, and 9¾d. in 1892. On flour, 1s. 0¼d. in 1879, 3s. 9¾d. in
1885, 5s. 4d. in 1888, and 3s. 8½d. in 1892. The new German
tariff of 1906 which formed the basis for the new German commercial
treaties with Russia, Italy, Austria-Hungary, &amp;c., and
which was passed when the influence of the agrarian party was
predominant, increased still more the import duties on cereals.
Under this tariff there are two rates of duties: (1). Those of the
new &ldquo;general&rdquo; tariff as applied to imports from all countries
entitled to most favoured-nation treatment. (2). &ldquo;Conventional&rdquo;
tariff rates, conceded to other states as the result of
treaties. Under this tariff the &ldquo;general&rdquo; and &ldquo;conventional&rdquo;
duties, respectively, on wheat are 3s. 9½d. and 2s. 9d.; on oats
<span class="sidenote">Austria-Hungary.</span>
and rye, 3s. 6½d. and 2s. 6¼d.; on &ldquo;common baker&rsquo;s
produce,&rdquo; 8s. 3d. and 5s. 2d. In Austria-Hungary the
import duty on wheat and rye is, under the tariff of
1887, 1s. 6¼d. per cwt.; on barley and oats, 9¼d.; on maize,
6d., and on flour, 3s. 9¾d.</p>

<p>The great countries, famous for a production of raw materials
much beyond their own means of consumption, are favourable, of
course, to the utmost freedom of export. The empire
<span class="sidenote">United States.</span>
of China itself was never unwilling to sell to foreigners
tea for which there was no domestic use.
The United States promotes transit and export of grain, internally and
externally, with all the intelligence and resources of a civilized
people. Although the import duty on &ldquo;breadstuffs&rdquo; imposed
by the United States tariff is very high, and is, possibly, a
useful protection against the importation of &ldquo;baker&rsquo;s products,&rdquo;
yet it is to a certain extent unnecessary for a country which must
dispose of its surplus by exportation. The same remark applies
<span class="sidenote">Russia.</span>
to Russia, whose exportation and importation are
alike free, though there is an import duty on wheat
flour of 2s. 11½d. per cwt. In the British colonies probably the
only example of an export duty is that on rice in British India;
<span class="sidenote">India.</span>
it amounts to 3 annas per maund (4d. per cwt.). The
import of grain into India is free. In Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, and all mainly agricultural countries, there is
no export duty. In each of these countries, however, there is an
<span class="sidenote">Australia, New Zealand, Canada.</span>
import duty; in the cases of Australia and New
Zealand, designed, to a certain extent, as a precaution
against possible rivalry on the part of the other. The
Australian import duty is 1s. 6d. per cental (100 &#8468; av.),
and the New Zealand 9d. per cental. The Canadian import
duties on grain are important only in the light of being a species of
retaliation against similar duties imposed by the United States
with the design of restricting inter-frontier exchange. The
Canadian import duty is, on barley, 30% <i>ad valorem</i>; on
buckwheat, rye and oats, 4.93d. per bushel, and on wheat,
<span class="sidenote">South Africa.</span>
5.92d. per bushel. The South African production of
cereal is still insufficient to meet the demand for home
consumption, and there is a considerable grain importation.
The import duty, which undoubtedly acts as an encouragement
to home agriculture, is 1s. per cental. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Grain

born at Orleans on the 6th of March 1841, and after being
educated at the École Polytechnique and the École des Mines,
became in 1867 professor of experimental physics in the former
institution, where he remained throughout his life. Although he
made various excursions into other branches of physical science,
undertaking, for example, with J. B. A. Bailie about 1870 a
repetition of Cavendish&rsquo;s experiment for determining the mean
density of the earth, his original work was mainly concerned with
optics and spectroscopy. In particular he carried out a classical
redetermination of the velocity of light by A. H. L. Fizeau&rsquo;s
method, introducing various improvements in the apparatus,
which added greatly to the accuracy of the results. This achievement
won for him, in 1878, the <i>prix Lacaze</i> and membership of the
Academy of Sciences in France, and the Rumford medal of the
Royal Society in England. In 1899, at the jubilee commemoration
of Sir George Stokes, he was Rede lecturer at Cambridge,
his subject being the undulatory theory of light and its influence
on modern physics; and on that occasion the honorary degree of
D.Sc. was conferred on him by the university. He died at Paris
on the 11th of April 1902.</p>

and abundance, and hence in works of art it is placed in the hands
of Plutus, Fortuna and similar divinities (for the mythological
account see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Amaltheia</a></span>). The symbol probably originated in the
practice of using the horns of oxen and goats as drinking-cups;
hence the <i>rhyton</i> (drinking-horn) is often confounded with the

At the time of the Second Punic War it is spoken of as the
principal city of the district, and its capture by the Romans was
the last act in the suppression of the rebellion of 215 B.C., it
having served as a place of refuge for the fugitives after the
defeat of the combined forces of the rebels and the Carthaginians.
The site of the ancient acropolis, covered with débris, may still be
made out. Here were found three inscriptions in 1831, with
dedications by the <i>ordo</i>, or town council, of Cornus to various
patrons, from one of which it seems that it was a colony, though
when it became so is unknown (Th. Mommsen, <i>Corp. Inscr. Lat.</i>

(perhaps) of a church exist. Excavations in the necropolis of

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORNUTUS, LUCIUS ANNAEUS,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> Stoic philosopher, flourished
in the reign of Nero. He was a native of Leptis in Libya, but
resided for the most part in Rome. He is best known as the
teacher and friend of Persius, whose satires he revised for publication
after the poet&rsquo;s death, but handed them over to Caesius
Bassus to edit, at the special request of the latter. He was
banished by Nero (in 66 or 68) for having indirectly disparaged
the emperor&rsquo;s projected history of the Romans in heroic verse
(Dio Cassius lxii. 29), after which time nothing more is heard
of him. He was the author of various rhetorical works in both
Greek and Latin (<span class="grk" title="Rhêtorikai Technai">&#8190;&#929;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#932;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>, <i>De figuris sententiarum</i>).
Another rhetorician, also named Cornutus, who flourished A.D.
200-250 (or in the second half of the 2nd century) was the author
of a treatise <span class="grk" title="Technê tou politikou logou">&#932;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965;</span> (ed. J. Graeven, 1890).

which the Greek title is uncertain; perhaps, <span class="grk" title="Hellênikê theologia">&#904;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span>,

an abridgment of the former) is still extant. It is a manual of
&ldquo;popular mythology as expounded in the etymological and
symbolical interpretations of the Stoics&rdquo; (Sandys), and although
marred by many absurd etymologies, abounds in beautiful
thoughts (ed. C. Lang, 1881). Simplicius and Porphyry refer
to his commentary on the <i>Categories</i> of Aristotle, whose philosophy
he is said to have defended against an opponent Athenodorus
in a treatise <span class="grk" title="Antigraphêpros Athênodôron">&#902;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8052;&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#902;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#972;&#948;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>. His Aristotelian studies
were probably his most important work. A commentary on
Virgil (frequently quoted by Servius) and <i>Scholia</i> to Persius are
also attributed to him; the latter, however, are of much later
date, and are assigned by Jahn to the Carolingian period.
Excerpts from his treatise <i>De enuntiatione vel orthographia</i> are
preserved in Cassiodorus. The so-called <i>Disticha Cornuti</i> (ed.

Indians of the Iroquois tribe.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORNWALL,<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> the south-westernmost county of England,
bounded N. and N.W. by the Atlantic Ocean, E. by Devonshire,
and S. and S.W. by the English Channel. The area is 1356.6
sq. m. The most southerly extension is Lizard Point, and the
most westerly point of the mainland Land&rsquo;s End, but the county
also includes the Scilly Isles (q.v.), lying 25 m. W. by S. of Land&rsquo;s
End. No county in England has a stronger individuality than
Cornwall, whether in economic or social conditions, in history,
nomenclature, tradition, or even in the physical characteristics
of the land. Such individuality is hardly to be compassed
within political boundaries, and in some respects it is shared by
the neighbouring county of Devon, yet the traveller hardly feels
its influence before passing west of the Tamar.</p>

<p>Physically, Cornwall is a great promontory with a direct
length of 75 m. from N.N.E. to S.S.W., and an extreme breadth,
at the junction with Devonshire, of 45 m. The river Tamar
here forms the greater part of the boundary, and its valley
divides the high moors of Devonshire and the succession of similar
broad-topped hills which form the backbone of the Cornish
promontory. The scenery is full of contrast. To the west of
Launceston the principal mass of high land rises to 1375 ft. in
Brown Willy, the highest point in the county. This district is
broken and picturesque, with rough <i>tors</i> or hills and boulders.
A remarkable pile of rocks called the Cheese-wring, somewhat
resembling an inverted pyramid in form, is seen on the moor
north of Liskeard. This district is for the most part a region of
furze and heather; but after passing Bodmin, the true Cornish
moorland asserts itself, bare, desolate and impracticable, broken
and dug into hillocks, which are sometimes due to early mining
works, sometimes to more modern search for metals. The
seventy miles from Launceston to Mount&rsquo;s Bay have been called
not untruly &ldquo;the dreariest strip of earth traversed by any
English high road.&rdquo; There is hardly more cultivation on the
higher ground west of Mount&rsquo;s Bay, or in the Meneage or &ldquo;rocky
country,&rdquo; the old Cornish name for the promontory which ends
in the Lizard. Long combes and valleys, however, descend
from this upper moorland towards the coast on both sides. These
are in general well wooded, and, in the luxuriance of their vegetation,
strongly characteristic. The small rivers traversing them
in several cases enter fine estuaries, which ramify deeply into the
land. Such are, on the south coast, the great estuary of the
Tamar, and other streams, on which the port of Plymouth is
situated (but only the western shore is Cornish), the Looe and
Fowey rivers, Falmouth Harbour, the most important of the
purely Cornish inlets and accessible for the largest vessels, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
the Helford river. On the north are the estuaries of the Camel
and the Hayle, debouching into Padstow Bay and St Ives Bay
respectively. The Fowey and Camel valleys almost completely
break the continuation of the central high ground, and the uplands
west of Mount&rsquo;s Bay are similarly parted from the main
mass by the low tract between Hayle and Marazion. Except at
the mouth of a stream or estuary the coast is almost wholly
rock-bound, and the cliff scenery is unsurpassed in England.
Three different types are found. On the north coast, from
Tintagel Head and Boscastle northward to Hartland Point in
Devonshire, the dark slate cliffs, with their narrow and distorted
strata, are remarkably rugged of outline, owing to the ease with
which the waves fret the loosely-bound rock. On the south,
in the beautiful little bays in the neighbourhood of the Lizard
Point, the serpentine rock is noted for its exquisite colouring.
Between Treryn and Land&rsquo;s End, at the south-west, a majestic
barrier of granite is presented to the sea. The beautiful Scilly
Isles continue the line of the granite, and the intervening sea
is said to have submerged a tract of land named Lyonesse,
containing, according to tradition, 140 parish churches, and
intimately connected with the Arthurian romances.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;One of the most striking features of Cornwall is the
presence of the four great masses of granite which rise up and form
as many elevated areas out of a lower-lying region occupied by rocks
almost entirely slaty in character, generally known as &ldquo;Killas.&rdquo;
The granite is not the oldest of the Cornish rocks; these are found
in the Lizard peninsula and are represented by serpentine, gabbro
and metamorphic schists. With the exception of a small tract about
Veryan and Gorran, of Ordovician age, all the sedimentary rocks,
as far as a line joining Boscastle and South Petherwin, were formerly
classed as Devonian; to the north of the line are the Culm measures&mdash;slates,
grits and limestones&mdash;of Carboniferous age. The extensive
spread of Killas is not, however, entirely Devonian, as it is shown
on most maps. In the northern portion, Lower, Middle and Upper
Devonian can be distinguished; the lower beds at Polperro, Looe
and Watergate, the higher beds along the line indicated above.
Farther south it has been shown that an older set of Palaeozoic rocks
constitutes at least a part of the Killas; the Veryan series, with
Caradoc fossils, is succeeded in descending order by the Portscatho
series, the Falmouth series and the Mylor series; the lowest Devonian
beds represented here by the Menaccan series, rest unconformably
upon these Ordovician beds. Upper Silurian fossils have been found
near Veryan. All these rocks have been subjected to severe thrusting
from the south, consequently they are much contorted and folded.
After this thrusting and folding had taken place, intrusions of diabase,
&amp;c., penetrated the sedimentary Strata in numerous places, but it
was not until post-Carboniferous times that the granite masses were
intruded. The principal granite masses are those of St Just and
Land&rsquo;s End, Penryn, St Austell and Bodmin Moor. To the granite
Cornwall owes much of its prosperity; it has altered the Killas for
some distance around each mass, and the veins of tin and copper ore,
though richest in the Killas, are evidently genetically related to the
granite. The principal metalliferous districts, Camborne, Redruth,
St Just, &amp;c., all lie near the granite margins. The china clay and
china stone industry is dependent on the fact that the granite was
itself altered in patches during the later phases of eruptive activity
by the agency of boric and fluoric vapours which kaolinized the
felspar of the granite. Later eruptions produced dykes of quartz-porphyry
and other varieties, all locally called &ldquo;elvans,&rdquo; which
penetrate both the granite and the Killas. Small patches of Pliocene
strata are found at St Erth and St Agnes Beacon. Blown sand is an
important feature at St Pirran, Lelant, Gwythian and elsewhere,
and raised beaches are frequent round the coast. A characteristic
Cornish deposit is the &ldquo;Head,&rdquo; an old consolidated scree or talus.
Many rare minerals have been obtained from the mines and much
tin ore has been taken from the river gravels. The river gravel at
Carnon has yielded native gold.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate of Cornwall is peculiar. Snow seldom
lies for more than a few days, and the winters are less severe
than in any other part of England, the average temperature
for January being 34° F. at Bude and 43.7° at Falmouth. The
sea-winds, except in a few sheltered places, prevent timber trees
from attaining to any great size, but the air is mild, and the
lower vegetation, especially in the Penzance district, is almost
southern in its luxuriance. Geraniums, fuchsias, myrtles,
hydrangeas and camellias grow to a considerable size, and
flourish through the winter at Penzance and round Falmouth;
and in the Scilly Isles a great variety of exotics may be seen
flourishing in the open air. Stone fruit, and even apples and
pears, do not attain the same full flavour as in the neighbouring
county, owing to the want of dry heat. The pinaster, the <i>Pinus</i>
<i>austriaca</i>, <i>Pinus insignis</i> and other firs succeed well in the
western part of the county. All native plants display a perfection
of beauty hardly to be seen elsewhere, and the furze,
including the double-blossomed variety, and the heaths, among
which <i>Erica vagans</i> and <i>ciliaris</i> are characteristic, cover the
moorland and the cliff summits with a blaze of the richest colour.
On the whole the climate is healthy, though the prevalent westerly
and south-westerly winds, bringing with them great bodies of
cloud from the Atlantic, render it damp; the mean annual
rainfall, though only 32.85 in. at Bude, reaches 44.41 at Falmouth,
and 50.57 at Bodmin.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;About seven-tenths of the total area is under
cultivation, but oats form the only important grain-crop. Turnips,
swedes and mangolds make up the bulk of the green crops.
The number of cattle (chiefly of the Devonshire breed) is large,
and many sheep are kept; nearly 60,000 acres of hill pasture
being recorded. As regards agricultural produce, however,
Cornwall is chiefly famous for the market-gardening carried on
in the neighbourhood of Penzance, where the climate is specially
suitable for the growth of early potatoes, broccoli and asparagus.
These are despatched in large quantities to the London market;
the Scilly Isles sharing in the industry. Fruit and flowers are
also grown for the market. In the valleys the soil is frequently
rich and deep; there are good arable and pasture farms, and
the natural oak-wood of these coombes has been preserved and
increased by plantation.</p>

<p><i>Mining.</i>&mdash;The wealth of Cornwall, however, lies not so much in
the soil, as underground and in the surrounding seas. Hence the
favourite Cornish toast, &ldquo;fish, tin and copper.&rdquo; The tin of
Cornwall has been known and worked from a period anterior to
certain history. There is no direct proof that the Phoenician
traders came to Cornwall for tin; though it has been sought to
identify the Cassiterides (q.v.) or Tin Islands with the county
or the Scilly Isles. By ancient charters the &ldquo;tinners&rdquo; were
exempt from all jurisdiction (save in cases affecting land, life and
limb) other than that of the Stannary Courts, and peculiar laws
were enacted in the Stannary parliaments (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stannaries</a></span>).
For many centuries a tax on the tin, after smelting, was paid to
the earls and dukes of Cornwall. The smelted blocks were
carried to certain towns to be coined, that is, stamped with the
duchy seal before they could be sold. By an act of 1838 the dues
payable on the coinage of tin were abolished, and a compensation
was awarded to the duchy instead of them. The Cornish miners
are an intelligent and independent body, and the assistance of a
Cornishman has been found necessary to the successful development
of mining in many parts of the world, while many miners
have emigrated from Cornwall to more remunerative fields abroad.
The industry has suffered from periods of depression, as before
the accession of Queen Elizabeth, who introduced miners from
Germany to resuscitate it; and in modern times the shallow
workings, from which tin could be easily &ldquo;streamed,&rdquo; have
become practically exhausted. The deeper workings to which
the miners must needs have recourse naturally render production
more costly, and the competition of foreign mines has been
detrimental. The result is that the industry is comparatively
less prosperous than formerly, and employs far fewer of the
inhabitants. However, in the district of Camborne, Carn Brea,
Illogan and Redruth, and near St Just in the extreme west, the
mines are still active, while there are others of less importance
elsewhere, as near Callington in the south-east. And when, as in
1906, circumstances affecting the production of foreign mines
cause a rise in the price of tin, the Cornish mines enjoy a period of
greater prosperity; the result being the recent reopening of many
of the mines which had been closed for twenty years. The largest
tin-mine is that of Dolcoath near Camborne. Copper is extracted
at St Just and at Carn Brea; but the output has decreased much
further than that of tin. As it lies deeper in the earth, and
consequently could not be &ldquo;streamed&rdquo; for, it was almost
unnoticed in the county until the end of the 15th century, and
little attention was paid to it until the last years of the 17th.
No mine seems to have been worked exclusively for copper before
the year 1770; and up to that time the casual produce had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
bought by Bristol merchants, to their great gain, at rates from
£2 : 10s. to £4 per ton. In 1718 John Coster gave a great
impulse to the trade by draining some of the deeper mines, and
instructing the men in an improved method of dressing the ore.
The trade thereafter progressively increased, and in 1851 the
mines of Devon and Cornwall together were estimated to
furnish one-third of the copper raised throughout Europe,
including the British Isles. Antimony ores and manganese are
found, and some lead occurs, being worked without great result.
Iron in lodes, as brown haematite, has been worked near Lostwithiel
and elsewhere. In the St Austell district the place of tin
and copper mining has been taken by that of the raising and
preparation of china clay. Granite is largely quarried in various
districts, as at Luxulian (between St Austell and Lostwithiel),
and in the neighbourhood of Penryn. This is the material of
London and Waterloo Bridges, the Chatham docks, and many
other great works. It is for the most part coarse-grained, though
differing greatly in different places in this respect. Fine slate is
quarried and largely exported, as from the Delabole quarries near
Tintagel. These slates were in great repute in the 16th century
and earlier. Serpentine is quarried in the Lizard district, and is
worked there into small ornamental objects for sale to visitors;
it is in favour as a decorative stone. Pitchblende also occurs,
and is mined for the extraction of radium.</p>

<p><i>Fisheries.</i>&mdash;The fisheries of Cornwall and Devon are the most
important on the south-west coasts. The pilchard is in great
measure confined to Cornwall, living habitually in deep water not
far west of the Scilly Isles, and visiting the coast in great shoals,&mdash;one
of which is described as having extended from Mevagissey
to the Land&rsquo;s End, a distance, including the windings of the coast,
of nearly 100 m. In summer and autumn pilchards are caught
by drift nets; later in the year they are taken off the northern
coast by seine nets. Forty thousand hogsheads, or 120 million
fish, have been taken in the course of a single season, requiring
20,000 tons of salt to cure them. Twelve millions have been
taken in a single day; and the sight of this great army of fish
passing the Land&rsquo;s End, and pursued by hordes of dog-fish, hake,
and cod, besides vast flocks of sea-birds, is most striking. The
principal fishing stations are on Mount&rsquo;s Bay and at St Ives, but
boats are employed all along the coast. When brought to shore
the pilchards are carried to the cellars to be cured. They are
then packed in hogsheads, each containing about 2400 fish.
These casks are largely exported to Naples and other Italian ports&mdash;whence
the fisherman&rsquo;s toast, &ldquo;Long life to the pope, and death
to thousands.&rdquo; Besides pilchards, mackerel and herring are taken
in great numbers, and conger eels of great size; mullet and John
Dory may be mentioned. There is also a trade in &ldquo;sardines,&rdquo;
young pilchards taking the place of the real Mediterranean fish.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The principal ports are Falmouth and
Penzance, but that of Hayle is of some importance, and there are
large engineering works here. It lies on the estuary of the Hayle
river, which opens into St Ives Bay, the township of Phillack
adjoining on the north-east. A brisk coasting trade is maintained
at many small ports along the coast. Communications are
provided chiefly by the Great Western railway, the main line of
which passes through the county and terminates at Penzance.
Fowey, Penryn and Falmouth, and Helston on the south, and
Bodmin and Wadebridge, Newquay and St Ives, are served by
branch lines. A light railway runs from Liskeard to Looe.
The north-eastern parts of the county (Launceston, Bude,
Wadebridge) are served by the London &amp; South-Western
railway. Coaches are run in several districts during the summer,
and in some parts, as in the neighbourhood of Penzance, and
between Helston and the Lizard, the Great Western company
provides a motor-car service to places beyond the reach of the
railway. Many of the small seaside towns have become favourite
holiday resorts, such as Bude, Newquay and St Ives, and the
south-coast ports.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The area of the ancient
county is 868,220 acres, with a population in 1891 of 322,571, and
in 1901 of 322,334. In 1861 the population was 369,390, and had
shown an increase up to that census. The area of the administrative
county is 886,384 acres. The county contains 9 hundreds.
The municipal boroughs are Bodmin (pop. 5353), the county
town; Falmouth (11,789), Helston (3088), Launceston (4053),
Liskeard (4010), Lostwithiel (1331), Penryn (3190), Penzance
(13,136), St Ives (6699), Saltash (3357), Truro (11,562), an
episcopal city. The other urban districts are Callington (1714),
Camborne (14,726), Hayle (1084), Looe (2548), Ludgvan (2274),
Madron (3486), Newquay (3115), Padstow (1566), Paul (6332),
Phillack (3881), Redruth (10,451), St Austell (3340), St Just
(5646), Stratton and Bude (2308), Torpoint (4200), Wadebridge
(2186). Small market and other towns, beyond those in the
above lists, are numerous. Such are Calstock in the east, St
Germans in the south-east near Saltash, St Blazey near St
Austell, Camelford, St Columb Major, and Perranzabuloe in the
north, with the mining towns of Gwennap and Illogan in the
Redruth district and Wendron near Helston, all inland towns;
while on the south coast may be mentioned Fowey and Mevagissey,
on either side of St Austell Bay, and Marazion on Mount&rsquo;s
Bay, close by St Michael&rsquo;s Mount. Cornwall is in the western
circuit, and assizes are held at Bodmin. It has one court of
quarter sessions, and is divided into 17 petty sessional divisions.
The boroughs of Bodmin, Falmouth, Helston, Launceston,
Liskeard, Penryn, Penzance, St Ives and Truro have separate
commissions of the peace, and Penzance has a separate court of
quarter sessions. The Scilly Isles are administered by a separate
council, and form one of the petty sessional divisions. There are
239 civil parishes, of which 5 are in the Scilly Isles. Cornwall is
in the diocese of Truro, and there are 227 ecclesiastical parishes or
districts wholly or in part within the county. The parliamentary
divisions are the North-Eastern or Launceston, South-Eastern or
Bodmin, Mid or St Austell, Truro, North-Western or Camborne,
and Western or St Ives, each returning one member; while the
parliamentary borough of Penryn and Falmouth returns one
member.</p>

<p><i>Language.</i>&mdash;The old Cornish language survives in a few words
still in use in the fishing and mining communities, as well as in
the names of persons and places, but the last persons who spoke
it died towards the end of the 18th century. It belonged to the
Cymric division of Celtic, in which Welsh and Armorican are
also included. The most important relics of the language known
to exist are three dramas or miracle plays, edited and translated
by Edwin Norris, Oxford, 1859. A sketch of Cornish grammar
is added, and a Cornish vocabulary from a MS. of the 13th
century (Cotton MSS. Vespasian A. 14, p. 7a). (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Celt:
Language and Literature</a></span>.) It may be mentioned that the great
numbers of saints whose names survive in the topography of the
county are largely accounted for by the fact that here, as in
Wales, it was the practice to canonize the founder of a church.
The natives have many traits in common with the Welsh, such
as their love of oratory and their strong tribal attachment to
the county.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Cornwall was the last portion of British territory
in the south to submit to the Saxon invader. Viewed from its
eastern boundary it doubtless appeared less attractive than the
rich, well-wooded lands of Wessex, while it unquestionably
afforded greater obstacles in the way of conquest. In 815
Ecgbert directed his efforts towards the subjugation of the
West-Welsh of Cornwall, and after eight years&rsquo; fighting compelled
the whole of Dyvnaint to acknowledge his supremacy. Assisted
by the Danes the Cornish revolted but were again defeated,
probably in 836, at the battle of Hengestesdun, Hingston Down
in Stoke-Climsland. Ninety years later Aethelstan banished
the West-Welsh from Exeter and made the Tamar the boundary
of their territory. The thoroughness of the Saxon conquest is
evident from the fact that in the days of the Confessor nearly
the whole of the land in Cornwall was held by men bearing
English names. As the result of the Norman conquest less than
one-twelfth of the land (exclusive of that held by the Church)
remained in English hands. Six-sevenths of the manors were
assigned to Robert, count of Mortain, and became the foundation
of the territorial possessions and revenues of the earldom which
was held until 1337, usually by special grant, by the sons or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
near relatives of the kings of England. On the death of John
of Eltham the last earl, in 1337, Edward the Black Prince was
created duke of Cornwall. By the terms of the statute under
which the dukedom was created the succession was restricted
to the eldest son of the king, but in 1613, on the death of Prince
Henry, an extended interpretation, given by the king&rsquo;s advisers,
enabled his brother Charles (afterwards Charles I.) to succeed
as son of the king and next heir to the realm of England.</p>

<p>Traces of jurisdictional differentiation anterior to Domesday
survive in the names of at least five of the hundreds, although
these names do not appear in the Survey itself. The hundreds
into which the county was divided at the time of the <i>Inquisitio
Geldi</i> were as follows:&mdash;Straton, which embraced the present
hundreds of Stratton, Lesnewth and Trigg; Fawiton, approximately
conterminous with West; Panton, now included in
Pydasr, Tibeste, Wineton, Conarditon and Rileston, very nearly
identical with Powder, Kerrier, Penwith and East. The shire
court was held at Launceston except from about 1260 to 1386,
when it was held at Lostwithiel. In 1716 the summer assize
was transferred to Bodmin. Since 1836 both assizes have been
held at Bodmin. The jurisdiction of the hundred courts became
early attached to various manors, and their bailiwicks and
bedellaries descended with the real estate of their owners. There
is much obscurity concerning the early ecclesiastical organization.
It is certain, however, that Cornwall had its own bishops from
the middle of the 9th century until the year 1018, when the see
was removed to Crediton. During the interval the see had been
placed sometimes at Bodmin and sometimes at St Germans. In
1049 the see of the united dioceses of Devon and Cornwall was
fixed at Exeter. Cornwall was formed into an archdeaconry
soon after, and, as such, continued until 1876, when it was reconstituted
a diocese with its see at Truro. The parishes of
St Giles-on-the-Heath, North Petherwin and Wellington, wholly
in Devon, and Boyton, partly in Devon and partly in Cornwall,
which were portions of the ancient archdeaconry, and also the
parishes of Broadwoodwidger and Virginstowe, both in Devon,
which had been added to it in 1875, thus came to be included
in the Truro diocese. The present archdeaconries of Bodmin
embracing the eastern, and of Cornwall embracing the western
portion of the newly constituted diocese were formed, by order
in council, in 1878. Aethelstan&rsquo;s enactment had doubtless
roughly determined the civil boundary of the Celtic-speaking
county. In 1386 disputes having arisen, a commission was
appointed to determine the Cornish border between North
Tamerton and Hornacot.</p>

<p>For the first four centuries after the Norman conquest the
part played by Cornwall in England&rsquo;s political history was comparatively
unimportant. In her final attempt in 1471 to restore
the fortunes of the house of Lancaster, Queen Margaret received
the active support of the Cornish, who, under Sir Hugh Courtenay
and Sir John Arundell, accompanied her to the fatal field of
Tewkesbury, and in 1473 John de Vere, earl of Oxford, held
St Michael&rsquo;s Mount in her behalf until the following February,
when he surrendered to John Fortescue. A rising of considerable
magnitude in 1497 at the instigation of Thomas Flamank,
occasioned by the levy of a tax for the Scottish war, was only
repelled after the arrival of the insurgents at Blackheath in Kent.
Perkin Warbeck, who landed at Whitsand Bay in the parish of
Sennen, obtained general support in the same year. The imposition
of the Book of Common Prayer and the abrogation of
various religious ceremonies led to a rebellion in 1549 under Sir
Humphry Arundell of Lanherne, the rebels, who knew little
English, demanding the restoration of the Latin service, but a
fatal delay under the walls of Exeter led to their early defeat
and the execution of their leaders. During the Civil War of the
17th century Cornwall won much glory in the royal cause. In
1643 Sir Ralph Hopton, who commanded the king&rsquo;s Cornish
troops, defeated General Ruthen on Bradoc Down, while General
Chudleigh, another parliamentary general, was repulsed near
Launceston, and the earl of Stamford at Stratton. The whole
county was thereby secured to the king. Led by Sir Beville
Grenville of Stow the Cornish troops now marched into Somersetshire,
where in the indecisive battle of Lansdowne they greatly
distinguished themselves, but lost their brave leader. In July
1644 the earl of Essex marched into Cornwall and was followed
soon afterwards by the king&rsquo;s troops in pursuit. Numerous
engagements were fought, in which the latter were uniformly
successful. The troops of Essex were surrounded and their
leader escaped in a boat from Fowey to Plymouth. In 1646,
owing to dissensions amongst the king&rsquo;s officers, and in particular
to the refusal of Sir Richard Grenville to serve under Lord
Hopton, and to the defection of Colonel Edgcumbe, the royal
cause declined and became desperate. On the 16th of August
1646 articles of capitulation were signed by the defenders of
Pendennis Castle.</p>

<p>Two members for the county were summoned by Edward I.
to the parliament of 1295, and two continued to be the number
of county members until 1832. Six boroughs&mdash;Launceston,
Liskeard, Lostwithiel, Bodmin, Truro and Helston&mdash;were granted
the like privilege by the same sovereign. To strengthen and
augment the power of the crown as against the House of Commons,
between 1547 and 1584, fifteen additional towns and villages
received the franchise, with the result that, between the latter
date and 1821, Cornwall sent no less than forty-four members
to parliament. In 1821 Grampound lost both its members, and
by the Reform Act in 1832 fourteen other Cornish boroughs
shared the same fate. Cornwall was, in fact, notorious for the
number of its rotten boroughs. In the vicinity of Liskeard
&ldquo;within an area, which since 1885 ... is represented by only
one member, there were until 1832 nine parliamentary boroughs
returning eighteen members. In this area, on the eve of the
Reform Act, there was a population of only 14,224&rdquo; (Porrit,
<i>Unreformed House of Commons</i>, vol. i. p. 92). Bossiney, a village
near Camelford, Camelford itself, Lostwithiel, East Looe, West
Looe, Fowey and several others were disfranchised in 1832, but
even until the act of 1885 Bodmin, Helston, Launceston, Liskeard
and St Ives were separately represented, whereas Penzance was
not. Until this act was passed Truro, and Penryn with Falmouth,
returned two members each.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;No part of England is so rich as Cornwall in
prehistoric antiquities. These chiefly abound in the district
between Penzance and the Land&rsquo;s End, but they occur in all the
wilder parts of the county. They may be classed as follows.
(1) <i>Cromlechs.</i> These in the west of Cornwall are called &ldquo;quoits,&rdquo;
with reference to their broad and flat covering stones. The
largest and most important are those known as Lanyon, Mulfra,
Chûn and Zennor quoits, all in the Land&rsquo;s End district. Of these
Chûn is the only one which has not been thrown down. Zennor is
said to be the largest in Europe, while Lanyon, when perfect, was
of sufficient height for a man on horseback to ride under. Of
those in the eastern part of Cornwall, Trevethy near Liskeard and
Pawton in the parish of St Breock are the finest. (2) Rude
uninscribed <i>monoliths</i> are common to all parts of Cornwall.
Those at Boleigh or Boleit, in the parish of St Buryan, S.W. of
Penzance, called the Pipers, are the most important. (3)
<i>Circles</i>, none of which is of great dimensions. The principal are
the Hurlers, near Liskeard; the Boskednan, Boscawen-ûn, and
Tregeseal circles; and that called the Dawns-ûn, or Merry
Maidens, at Boleigh. All of these, except the Hurlers, are in the
Land&rsquo;s End district. Other circles that may be mentioned are the
Trippet Stones, in the parish of Blisland, near Bodmin, and one at
Duloe, near Liskeard. (4) Long <i>alignments</i> or <i>avenues</i> of stones,
resembling those on Dartmoor, but not so perfect, are to be
found on the moors near Rough Tor and Brown Willy. A very
remarkable monument of this kind exists in the neighbourhood of
St Columb Major, called the Nine Maidens. It consists of nine
rude pillars placed in a line, but now imperfect, while near them
is a single stone known as the Old Man. (5) <i>Hut dwellings.</i> Of
these there are at least two kinds, those in the eastern part of
the county resembling the beehive structures and enclosures of
Dartmoor, and those in the west comprising &ldquo;hut-clusters,&rdquo;
having a central court, and a surrounding wall sometimes of
considerable height and thickness. The beehive masonry is
also found in connexion with these, as are also (6) <i>Caves</i>, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
subterraneous structures, resembling those of Scotland and
Ireland. (7) <i>Cliff castles</i> are a characteristic feature of the
Cornish coast, especially in the west, such as Treryn, Mên,
Kenedjack, Bosigran and others. These are all fortified on the
landward side. At Treryn Castle is the Logan Stone, a mass of
granite so balanced as to rock upon its support. (8) <i>Hill castles</i>,
or camps, are very numerous. Castelan-Dinas, near St Columb,
is the best example of the earthwork camp, and Chûn Castle,
near Penzance, of the stone.</p>

<p>Early Christian remains in Cornwall include crosses, which
occur all over the country and are of various dates from the 6th
century onward; inscribed sepulchral stones, generally of the
7th and 8th centuries; and oratories. These last have their
parallels in Ireland, which is natural, since from that country and
Wales Cornwall was christianized. The buildings (also called
baptisteries) are very small and rude, a simple parallelogram in
form, always placed near a spring. The best example is St
Piran&rsquo;s near Perranzabuloe, which long lay buried in sand dunes.
St Piran was one of the missionaries sent from Ireland by St
Patrick in the 5th century, and became the patron saint of the
tin-miners.</p>

<p>The individuality of Cornwall is reflected in its ecclesiastical
architecture. The churches are generally massive, plain structures
of granite, built as it were to resist the storms which
sweep up from the sea, low in the body, but with high unadorned
towers. Within, a common feature is the absence of a chancel
arch. In a few cases, of which Gwennap church is an illustration,
where the body of the church lies low in a valley, there is a
detached campanile at a higher level. The prevalent style is
Perpendicular, much rebuilding having taken place in this period,
but there are fine examples of the earlier styles. The west front
and part of the towers of the church of St Germanus of Auxerre
at St Germans form the best survival of Norman work in the
county; there are good Norman doorways at Manaccan and
Kilkhampton churches, and the church of Morwenstow, near the
coast north of Bude, is a remarkable illustration of the same style.
This church has the further interest of having had as its rector
the Cornish poet Robert Stephen Hawker (1803-1875). The
Early English style is not commonly seen, but the small church
of St Anthony in Roseland, near the east shore of Falmouth
harbour (with an ornate Norman door), and portions of the
churches of Camelford and Manaccan, are instances of this period.
Decorated work is similarly scanty, but the churches of Sheviock,
in the south-east, and St Columb Major have much that is good,
and that of St Bartholomew, Lostwithiel, has a beautiful and rich
lantern and spire in this style surmounting an Early English
tower, while the body of the church is also largely Decorated.
Perpendicular churches are so numerous that it is only needful to
mention those possessing some peculiar characteristic. Thus,
the high ornamentation of Launceston and St Austell churches is
unusual in Cornwall, as is the rich and graceful tower of Probus
church. St Neot&rsquo;s church, near Liskeard, has magnificent stained
glass of the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>

<p>The ruined castles of Launceston, Trematon near Saltash,
Restormel near Lostwithiel, and Tintagel, date, at least in part,
from Norman times. St Michael&rsquo;s Mount was at once a fortress
and an ecclesiastical foundation. Pendennis Castle, Falmouth,
is of the time of Henry VIII. The mansions of Cornwall are
generally remarkable rather for their position than for architectural
interest, but Trelawne, partly of the 15th century, near
Looe, and Place House, a Tudor building, at Fowey, may be
noted.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORNWALLIS, CHARLES CORNWALLIS,<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> 1st <span class="sc">Marquess</span>
(1738-1805), eldest son of Charles, 1st earl of Cornwallis (1700-1762),
was born on the 31st of December 1738. Having been
educated at Eton and Clare College, Cambridge, he entered
the army. For some time he was member of parliament for Eye;
in 1761 he served a campaign in Germany, and was gazetted to a
lieutenant-colonelcy in the 12th Foot. In 1762 he succeeded to
the earldom and estates of his father; in 1765 he was made aide-de-camp
to the king and gentleman of the bedchamber; in 1766
he obtained a colonelcy in the 33rd Foot; and in 1770 he was
appointed governor of the Tower. In public life he was distinguished
by independence of character and inflexible integrity;
he voted without regard to party, and opposed the ministerial
action against Wilkes and in the case of the American colonies.
But when the American War of Independence broke out, he
accompanied his regiment across the Atlantic, and served not
without success as major-general. In 1780 he was appointed to
command the British forces in South Carolina, and in the same
year he routed Gates at Camden. In 1781 he defeated Greene at
Guilford Court House, and made a destructive raid into Virginia;
but he was besieged at Yorktown by French and American armies
and a French fleet, and was forced to capitulate on the 19th of
October 1781. With him fell the English cause in the United
States. He not only escaped censure, however, but in 1786
received a vacant Garter, and was appointed governor-general of
India and commander-in-chief in Bengal. As an administrator
he projected many reforms, but he was interrupted in his work by
the quarrel with Tippoo Sahib. In 1791 he assumed in person the
conduct of the war and captured Bangalore; and in 1792 he
laid siege to Seringapatam, and concluded a treaty with Tippoo
Sahib, which stripped the latter of half his realm, and placed
his two sons as hostages in the hands of the English. For the
permanent settlement of the land revenue under his administration,
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bengal</a></span>. He returned to England in 1793, received a
marquessate and a seat in the privy council, and was made
master-general of the ordnance with a place in the Cabinet.
In June 1798 he was appointed to the viceroyalty of Ireland, and
the zeal with which he strove to pacify the country gained him the
respect and good-will of both Roman Catholics and Orangemen.
On the 17th of July a general amnesty was proclaimed, and a
few weeks afterwards the French army under Humbert was
surrounded and forced to surrender. In 1801 Cornwallis was
replaced by Lord Hardwicke, and soon after he was appointed
plenipotentiary to negotiate the treaty of Amiens (1802). In
1805 he was again sent to India as governor-general, to replace
Lord Wellesley, whose policy was too advanced for the directors of
the East India Company. He was in ill-health when he arrived
at Calcutta, and while hastening up the country to assume
command of the troops, he died at Ghazipur, in the district of
Benares, on the 5th of October 1805. He was succeeded as 2nd
marquess by his only son, Charles (1774-1823). On his death the
marquessate became extinct, but the title of Earl Cornwallis
passed to his uncle, James (1743-1824), who was bishop of
Lichfield from 1781 until his death. His son and successor,
James, the 5th earl, whose son predeceased him in 1835, died in
May 1852, when the Cornwallis titles became extinct.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORNWALLIS, SIR WILLIAM<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (1744-1819), British admiral,
was the brother of the 1st Marquess Cornwallis, governor-general
of India. He was born on the 20th of February 1744, and entered
the navy in 1755. His promotion was naturally rapid, and in
1766 he had reached post-rank. Until 1779 he held various
commands doing the regular work of the navy in convoy. In
that year he commanded the &ldquo;Lion&rdquo; (64) in the fleet of Admiral
Byron. The &ldquo;Lion&rdquo; was very roughly handled in the battle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
off Grenada on the 6th of July 1779, and had to make her way
alone to Jamaica. In March 1780 he fought an action in company
with two other vessels against a much superior French force off
Monti Cristi, and had another encounter with them near Bermuda
in June. The force he engaged was the fleet carrying the troops
of Rochambeau to North America, and was too strong for his
squadron of two small liners, two fifty-gun ships and a frigate.
After taking part in the second relief of Gibraltar, he returned
to North America, and served with Hood in the actions at the
Basse Terre of St Kitts, and with Rodney in the battle of Dominica
on the 12th of April 1782. Some very rough verses which he wrote
on the action have been printed in Leyland&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Brest-Papers</i>,&rdquo;
published for the Navy Record Society, which show that he
thought very ill of Rodney&rsquo;s conduct of the battle. In 1788 he
went to the East Indies as commodore, where he remained till
1794. He had some share in the war with Tippoo Sahib, and
helped to reduce Pondicherry. His promotion to rear-admiral
dates from the 1st of February 1793, and on the 4th of July
1794 he became vice-admiral.</p>

<p>In the Revolutionary War his services were in the Channel.
The most signal of them was performed on the 16th of June
1795, when he carried out what was always spoken of with respect
as &ldquo;the retreat of Cornwallis.&rdquo; He was cruising near Brest with
four sail of the line and two frigates, when he was sighted by a
French fleet of twelve sail of the line, and many large frigates
commanded by Villarat Joyeuse. The odds being very great
he was compelled to make off. But two of his ships were heavy
sailers and fell behind. He was consequently overtaken, and
attacked on both sides. The rearmost ship, the &ldquo;Mars&rdquo; (74),
suffered severely in her rigging and was in danger of being
surrounded by the French. Cornwallis turned to support her,
and the enemy, impressed by a conviction that he must be
relying on help within easy reach, gave up the pursuit. The
action affords a remarkable proof of the moral superiority which
the victory of the 1st of June, and the known efficiency of the
crews, had given to the British navy. The reputation of Cornwallis
was immensely raised, and the praise given him was no
doubt the greater because he was personally very popular with
officers and men. In 1796 he incurred a court-martial in consequence
of a misunderstanding and apparently some temper on
both sides, on the charge of refusing to obey an order from the
Admiralty. He was practically acquitted. The substance of the
case was that he demurred on the ground of health at being
called upon to go to the West Indies, in a small frigate, and
without &ldquo;comfort.&rdquo; He became full admiral in 1799, and held
the Channel command for a short interval in 1801 and from 1803
to 1806, but saw no further service. He was made a G.C.B. in
1815, and died on the 5th of July 1819. His various nicknames
among the sailors, &ldquo;Billy go tight,&rdquo; given on account of his
rubicund complexion, &ldquo;Billy Blue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coachee,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr
Whip,&rdquo; seem to show that he was regarded with more of affection
than reverence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORO,<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> a small city and the capital of the state of Falcón,
Venezuela, 7 m. W. of La Vela de Coro (its port on the Caribbean
coast), with which it is connected by rail, and 199 m. W.N.W.
of Carácas. Pop. (1904, estimate) 9500. Coro stands on a sandy
plain between the Caribbean and the Gulf of Venezuela, and
near the isthmus connecting the peninsula of Paraguaná with the
mainland. Its elevation above sea-level is only 105 ft., and its
climate is hot but not unhealthy. The city is badly built, its
streets are unpaved, and it has no public buildings of note except
two old churches. Its water-supply is derived from springs
some distance away. Coro is the commercial centre for an
extensive district on the E. side of Lake Maracaibo and the
Gulf of Venezuela, which exports large quantities of goat-skins,
an excellent quality of tobacco, and some coffee, cacao, castor
beans, timber and dyewoods. It was founded in 1527 by Juan
de Ampués, who gave to it the name of Santa Ana de Coriana
(afterwards corrupted to Santa Ana de Coro) in honour of the
day and of the tribe of Indians inhabiting this locality. It was
also called Venezuela (little Venice) because of an Indian village
on the gulf coast built on piles over the shallow water; this
name was afterwards bestowed upon the province of which
Coro was the capital. Coro was also made the chief factory of
the Welsers, the German banking house to which Charles V.
mortgaged this part of his colonial possessions, and it was the
starting-point for many exploring and colonizing expeditions
into the interior. It was made a bishopric in 1536, and for a
time Coro was one of the three most important towns on the
northern coast. The seat of government was removed to
Carácas in 1578 and the bishopric five years later. Coro is
celebrated in Venezuelan history as the scene of Miranda&rsquo;s first
attempt to free his country from Spanish rule. It suffered
greatly in the war which followed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COROMANDEL COAST,<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> a name formerly applied officially
to the eastern seaboard of India approximately between Cape
Calimere, in 10° 17&prime; N., 79° 56&prime; E., and the mouths of the Kistna
river. The shore, which is low, is without a single good natural
harbour, and is at all times beaten by a heavy sea. Communication
with ships can be effected only by catamarans and flat-bottomed
surf-boats. The north-east monsoon, which lasts
from October till April, is exceedingly violent for three months
after its commencement. From April till October hot southerly
winds blow by day; at night the heat is tempered by sea-breezes.
The principal places frequented by shipping are Pulicat,
Madras, Sadras, Pondicherry, Cuddalore, Tranquebar, Nagore,
and Negapatam. The name Coromandel is said to be derived
from <i>Cholamandal</i>, the mandal or region of the ancient dynasty
of the Chola. Its official use has lapsed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORONA<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> (Lat. for &ldquo;crown&rdquo;), in astronomy, the exterior
envelope of the sun, being beyond the photosphere and chromosphere,
invisible in the telescope and unrecognized by the
spectroscope, except during a total eclipse (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sun</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Eclipse</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Corona Borealis</i>, also known as the <i>Corona septentrionalis</i>,
and the Northern Crown or Garland, is a constellation of the
Northern hemisphere, mentioned by Eudoxus (4th cent. B.C.) and
Aratus (3rd cent. B.C.). In the catalogues of Ptolemy, Tycho
Brahe, and Hevelius, eight stars are mentioned; but recent
uranographic surveys have greatly increased this number. The
most interesting members are: &sigma; <i>Coronae</i>, a binary consisting
of a yellow star of the 6th magnitude, and a bluish star of the
7th magnitude; <i>R Coronae</i>, an irregular variable star; and
<i>T Coronae</i> or <i>Nova Coronae</i>, a temporary or new star, first
observed in 1866. <i>Corona Australis</i>, also known as <i>Corona
meridionalis</i>, or the Southern Crown, is a constellation of the
Southern hemisphere, mentioned by Eudoxus and Aratus. In
Ptolemy&rsquo;s catalogue thirteen stars are described.</p>

<p>In physical science, coronae (or &ldquo;glories&rdquo;) are the coloured
rings frequently seen closely encircling the sun or moon. Formerly
classified by the ancient Greeks with halos, rainbows, &amp;c., under
the general group of &ldquo;meteors,&rdquo; they came to receive considerable
attention at the hands of Descartes, Christiaan Huygens, and
Sir Isaac Newton; but the correct explanation of coronae was
reserved until the beginning of the 19th century, when Thomas
Young applied the theories of the diffraction and interference
of light to this phenomenon. Prior to Young, halos and coronae
had not been clearly differentiated; they were both regarded as
caused by the refraction of light by atmospheric moisture and
ice, although observation had shown that important distinctions
existed between these phenomena. Thus, while halos have
certain definite radii, viz. 22° and 46°, the radii of coronae
vary very considerably; also, halos are coloured red on
the <i>inside</i>, whereas coronae are coloured red on the <i>outside</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Halo</a></span>).</p>

<p>It has now been firmly established, both experimentally and
mathematically, that coronae are due to diffraction by the
minute particles of moisture and dust suspended in the atmosphere,
and the radii of the rings depend on the size of the
diffracting particles. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diffraction of Light</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Other meteorological phenomena caused by the diffraction of
light include the <i>anthelia</i>, and the chromatic rings seen encircling
shadows thrown on a bank of clouds, mist or fog. These appearances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
differ from halos and coronae inasmuch as their centres are
at the anti-solar point; they thus resemble the rainbow. The
anthelia (from the Greek <span class="grk" title="anti">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;</span>, opposite, and <span class="grk" title="hêlios">&#7973;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>, the sun) are
coloured red on the inside, the outside being generally colourless
owing to the continued overlapping of many spectra. The
diameter increases with the size of the globules making up the
mist. The chromatic rings seen encircling the &ldquo;spectre of the
Brocken&rdquo; are similarly explained.</p>

<p>The blue colour of the sky (q.v.), supernumerary rainbows, and
the gorgeous sunsets observed after intense volcanic disturbances,
when the atmosphere is charged with large quantities of extremely
minute dust particles (e.g. Krakatoa), are also explicable by the
diffraction of light. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dust</a></span>.)</p>

<p>In architecture, the term &ldquo;corona&rdquo; is used of that part of a
cornice which projects over the bed mould and constitutes the
chief protection to the wall from rain; it is always throated, and
its soffit rises towards the wall. The term is also given to the
apse or semicircular termination of the choir; as at Canterbury in
the part called &ldquo;Becket&rsquo;s crown.&rdquo; The large circular chandelier
suspended in churches, of which the finest example is that given
by Barbarossa to Aix-la-Chapelle, is often called a corona. The
term is also used in botany of the crown-like appendage at the
top of compound flowers, the diminutive being <i>coronule</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORONADO, FRANCISCO VASQUEZ DE<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (c. 1500-c. 1545),
Spanish explorer of the south-western part of the United States of
America. He accompanied Antonio de Mendoza to New Spain in
1535;  by a brilliant marriage, became a leading grandee, and in
1539 was appointed governor of the province of New Galicia.
The report presented by Fray Marcos de Niza concerning the
&ldquo;Seven cities of Cibola&rdquo; (now identified almost certainly with
the Zuñi pueblos of New Mexico) aroused great interest in
Mexico; Melchior Diaz was sent late in 1539 to retrace Fray
Marcos&rsquo;s route and report on his story; and an expedition under
Coronado left Compostela for the &ldquo;Seven Cities&rdquo; in February
1540. This expedition consisted of a provision train and droves
of live-stock; several hundred friendly Indians, Spanish footmen,
and more than 250 horsemen. Coronado, with a part of this
force, captured the &ldquo;Seven Cities.&rdquo; The fabled wealth, however,
was not there. In the autumn (1540) Coronado was joined by the
rest of his army. Meanwhile exploring parties were sent out:
Tusayan, the Hopi or Moki (Moqui) country of north-eastern
Arizona, was visited; Garcia Lopez de Cardenas discovered and
described the Grand Canyon of the Colorado; and expeditions
were sent along the Rio Grande (Tuguez), where the army
wintered. The Indians revolted but were put down. The army,
reinspirited by the tales of a plains-Indian slave<a name="FnAnchor_1i" id="FnAnchor_1i" href="#Footnote_1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> about vast
herds of cows (bison) on the plains, and about an Eldorado called
&ldquo;Quivira&rdquo; far to the N.E., started thither in April 1541, and,
with a few horsemen, penetrated at least to what is now central
Kansas. Here Coronado found a few permanent settlements of
Indians; in October he was again on the Rio Grande; and in the
spring of 1542 he led his followers home. Thereafter he practically
disappears from history. The first description of the bison
and the prairie plains, the first trustworthy account of the Zuñi
pueblos, the discovery of the Grand Canyon, a vast increase of
the nominal dominion of Spain and Christianity (the priests did
not return from Cibola), and a notable addition to geographical
knowledge, which, however, was long forgotten, were the results
of this expedition; which is, besides, for its duration and the vast
distance covered, over mountains, desert and plains, one of the
most remarkable expeditions in the history of American discovery.
In connexion with it, in 1540, Hernando de Alarcon
ascended the Gulf of California to its head and the Colorado river
for a long distance above its mouth.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORONATION<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (Lat. <i>corona</i>, crown), a solemnity whereby
sovereigns are inaugurated in office. In pre-Christian times in
Europe the king or ruler, upon his election, was raised on a shield,
and, standing upon it, was borne on the shoulders of certain
of the chief men of the tribe, or nation, round the assembled
people. This was called the <i>gyratio</i>, and it was usually performed
three times. At its conclusion a spear was placed in the king&rsquo;s
hand, and the diadem, a richly wrought band of silk or linen,
which must not be confused with the crown (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crown and
Coronet</a></span>), was bound round his forehead, as a token of regal
authority. When Europe became Christian, a religious service of
benediction was added to the older form, which, however, was not
abandoned. Derived from the Teutons, the Franks continued the
<i>gyratio</i>, and Clovis, Sigebert, Pippin and others were thus
elevated to the royal estate. From a combination of the old
custom with the religious service, the later coronation ceremonies
were gradually developed. In the ceremonial procession of the
English king from the Tower to Westminster (first abandoned at
the coronation of James II.), in the subsequent elevation of the
king into what was known as the marble chair in Westminster
Hall, and in the showing of the king of France to the people, as
also in the universal practice of delivering a sceptre to the new
ruler, traces, it is thought, may be detected of the influence of the
original function.</p>

<p>The added religious service was naturally derived from the
Bible, where mention is frequently made, in the Old Testament,
of the anointing and crowning of kings. The anointing
of the king soon came to be regarded as the most important, if
not essential, feature of the service. By virtue of the unction
which he received, the sovereign was regarded, in the middle
ages, as a <i>mixta persona</i>, in part a priest, and in part a layman.
It was a strange theory, and Lyndwode, the great English
canonist, is cautious as to it, and was content to say that it was
the opinion of some people. It gained very wide acceptance, and
the anointed sovereign was generally regarded as, in some degree,
possessed of the priestly character. By virtue of the unction he
had received, the emperor was made a canon of St John Lateran
and of St Peter at Rome, and also of the collegiate church of
Aachen, while the king of France was <i>premier chanoine</i> of the
primatial church of Lyons, and held canonries at Embrun, Le
Mans, Montpellier, St Pol-de-Léon, Lodève, and other cathedral
churches in France. There are, moreover, trustworthy records
that, on more than one occasion, a king of France, habited in a
surplice and choir robes, took part with the clergy in the services
of some of those churches. Martène quotes an order, which
directs that at the imperial coronation at Rome, the pope ought
to sing the mass, the emperor read the gospel, and the king of
Sicily, or if present the king of France, the epistle. Nothing like
this was known in England, and a theory, which has prevailed of
late, that the English sovereign is, in a personal sense, canon of
St David&rsquo;s, is based on a misconception. The canonry in question
was attached to St Mary&rsquo;s College at St David&rsquo;s before the
Reformation, and, at the dissolution of the college, became crown
property, which it has remained ever since; but the king of
England is not, and never was personally, a canon of St David&rsquo;s,
nor did he ever perform any quasi-clerical function.</p>

<p>At first a single anointing on the head was the practice, but
afterwards other parts of the body, as the breast, arms, shoulders
and hands received the unction. From a very early period in
the West three kinds of oil have been blessed each year on
Maundy Thursday, the oil of the catechumens, the oil of the
sick, and the chrism. The last, a compound of olive oil and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
balsam, is only used for the most sacred purposes, and the oil
of the catechumens was that used for the unction of kings. In
France, however, a legend gained credence that, as a special
sign of divine favour, the Holy Dove had miraculously descended
from heaven, bearing a vessel (afterwards called the Sainte
Ampoule), containing holy oil, and had placed it on the altar
for the coronation of Clovis. A drop of oil from the Sainte
Ampoule mixed with chrism was afterwards used for anointing
the kings of France. Similarly the chrism was introduced into
English coronations, for the first time probably at the coronation
of Edward II. To rival the French story another miracle was
related that the Virgin Mary had appeared to Thomas Becket,
and had given him a vessel with holy oil, which at some future
period was to be used for the sacring of the English king. A full
account of this miracle, and the subsequent finding of the vessel,
is contained in a letter written in 1318 by Pope John XXII. to
Edward II. The chrism was used in addition to the holy oil.
The king was first anointed with the oil, and then signed on
the head with the chrism. In all other countries the oil of the
catechumens was alone used. In consequence of the use of
chrism the kings of England and France were thought to be
able to cure scrofula by the imposition of their hands, and hence
arose the practice in those countries of touching for the king&rsquo;s
evil, as it was called. In England the chrism disappeared at
the Reformation, but touching for the evil was continued till the
accession of the house of Hanover in 1714.</p>

<p>The oldest of all existing rituals for the coronation of a king
is contained in what is known as the Pontifical of Egbert, who
was archbishop of York in the middle of the 8th century. The
coronation service in it is entitled <i>Missa pro rege in die benedictionis
ejus</i>, and the coronation ceremony is interpolated in
the middle of the mass. After the Gospel the officiant recites
some prayers of benediction, and then pours oil from a horn on
the king&rsquo;s head, while the anthem &ldquo;Zadok the priest,&rdquo; &amp;c., is
sung. After this the assembled bishops and nobles place a
sceptre in the king&rsquo;s hands, while a form of intercessory benediction
is recited. Then the staff (<i>baculus</i>) is delivered to him,
and finally a helmet (<i>galea</i>) is set upon his head, the whole
assembly repeating thrice &ldquo;May King N. live for ever. Amen.
Amen. Amen.&rdquo; The enthronement follows, with the kisses
of homage and of fealty, and the mass, with special prayers,
is concluded.</p>

<p>Another coronation service of Anglo-Saxon date bearing, but
with no good reason, the name of Æthelred II., has also been
preserved, and is of importance as it spread from England to
the continent, and was used for the coronations of the kings of
France. It differs from the Egbert form as the coronation
precedes the mass, while the use of a ring, and the definite
allusion to a crown (<i>corona</i> not <i>galea</i>) occur in it. Joined
to it is the form for the coronation of a queen consort. It may
have been used for the crowning of Harold and of William the
Conqueror.</p>

<p>A third English coronation form, of the 12th century, bears
the name of Henry I., but also without good reason. The
ceremonial is more fully developed, and the king is anointed
on the head, breast, shoulders and elbows. The royal mantle
appears for the first time, as does the sceptre. The queen consort
is to be crowned <i>secundum ordinem Romanum</i>, and the whole
function precedes the mass.</p>

<p>The fourth and most important of all English coronation
services is that of the <i>Liber Regalis</i>, a manuscript still in the
keeping of the dean of Westminster. It was introduced in 1307,
and continued in use till the Reformation, and, in an English
translation and with the Communion service substituted for
the Latin mass, it was used for the coronation of James I. In it
the English coronation ceremonies reached their fullest development.
The following is a bare outline of its main features:&mdash;</p>

<p>The ceremonies began the day before the coronation, the king
being ceremonially conducted in a procession from the Tower
of London to Westminster. There he reposed for the night,
and was instructed by the abbot as to the solemn obligations
of the kingly office. Early next morning he went to Westminster
Hall, and there, among other ceremonies, as <i>rex regnaturus</i>
was elevated into a richly adorned seat on the king&rsquo;s bench,
called the Marble Chair. Then a procession with the regalia was
marshalled, and led into the abbey church, the king wearing
a cap of estate on his head, and supported by the bishops of
Bath and Durham. A platform with thrones, &amp;c., having been
previously prepared under the crossing, the king ascended it,
and all being in order, the archbishop of Canterbury called for
the Recognition, after which the king, approaching the high
altar, offered a pall to cover it, and a pound of gold. Then a
sermon appropriate to the occasion was preached by one of the
bishops, the oath was administered by the archbishop, and the
<i>Veni Creator</i> and a litany were sung. Then the king was anointed
with oil on his hands, breast, between the shoulders, on the
shoulders, on the elbows, and on the head; finally he was
anointed with the chrism on his head. Thus blessed and anointed,
the king was vested, first with a silk dalmatic, called the <i>colobium
sindonis</i>, then a long tunic, reaching to the ankles and woven
with great golden images before and behind, was put upon him.
He then received the buskins (<i>caligae</i>), the sandals (<i>sandalia</i>),
and spurs (<i>calcaria</i>), then the sword and its girdle; after this the
stole, and finally the royal mantle, four-square in shape and
woven throughout with golden eagles. Thus vested, the crown
of St Edward was set on his head, the ring placed on his wedding
finger, the gloves drawn over his hands, and the golden sceptre,
in form of an orb and cross, delivered to him. Lastly, the golden
rod with the dove at the top was placed in the king&rsquo;s left hand.
Thus consecrated, vested and crowned, the king kissed the
bishops who, assisted by the nobles, enthroned him, while the
<i>Te Deum</i> was sung. When a queen consort was also crowned,
that ceremony immediately followed, and the mass with special
collect, epistle, gospel and preface was said, and during it both
king and queen received the sacrament in one kind. At the
conclusion the king retired to a convenient place, surrounded
with curtains, where the great chamberlain took off certain of
the robes, and substituted others for them, and the archbishop,
still wearing his mass vestments, set other crowns on the heads
of the king and queen, and with these they left the church.</p>

<p>This service, in English, was used at the coronation of James
I., Elizabeth having been crowned with the Latin service.
Little change was made till 1685, when it was considerably
altered for the coronation of James II. The Communion was
necessarily omitted in the case of a Roman Catholic, but other
changes were introduced quite needlessly by Archbishop Sancroft,
and four years later the old order was still more seriously changed,
with the result that the revisions of 1685 and 1689 have grievously
mutilated the service, by confusing the order of its different
sections, while the meaning of the prayers has been completely
changed for no apparent reason. Alterations since then have
been verbal rather than essential, but at each subsequent
coronation some feature has disappeared, the proper preface
having been abandoned at the coronation of Edward VII.</p>

<p>In connexion with the English coronation a number of claims
to do certain services have sprung up, and before each coronation
a court of claims <span class="correction" title="amended from in">is</span> constituted, which investigates and adjudicates
on the claims that are made. The most striking of all these
services is that of the challenge made by the king&rsquo;s champion, an
office which has been hereditary in the Dymoke family for many
centuries. Immediately following the service in the church a
banquet was held in Westminster Hall, during the first course of
which the champion entered the hall on horseback, armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>,
with red, white and blue feathers in his helmet. He was
supported by the high constable on his right, and the earl marshal
on his left, both of whom were also mounted. On his appearance
in the hall a herald in front of him read the challenge, the words
of which have not materially varied at any period, as follows:
&ldquo;If any person, of what degree soever, high or low, shall deny or
gainsay our sovereign lord ..., king of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, defender of the faith (son and), next
heir unto our sovereign lord the last king deceased, to be the right
heir to the imperial crown of this realm of Great Britain and
Ireland, or that he ought not to enjoy the same; here is his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
champion, who saith that he lieth, and is a false traitor, being
ready in person to combat with him; and in this quarrel will
adventure his life against him, on what day soever he shall be
appointed.&rdquo; The champion then threw down the gauntlet. The
challenge was again made in the centre of the hall, and a third
time before the high table, at which the king was seated. The
king then drank to the champion out of a silver-gilt cup, with a
cover, which he handed to him as his fee. The banquet was last
held, and the challenge made, at the coronation of George IV. in
1821. The champion&rsquo;s claim was admitted in 1902, but as there
was no banquet the duty of bearing the standard of England was
assigned to him. There is no record of the challenge having been
ever accepted.</p>

<p>The revival of the western empire under Charlemagne was
marked by his coronation by the pope at Rome in the year 800.
His successors, for several centuries, went to Rome, where they
received the imperial crown in St Peter&rsquo;s from the pope, the
crown of Lombardy being conferred in the church of St Ambrose
(Sant&rsquo; Ambrogio) at Milan, that of Burgundy at Arles, and the
German crown, which came to be the most important of all, most
commonly at Aix-la-Chapelle. It must suffice to speak of the
coronations at Rome and Aix-la-Chapelle. From Martène we
learn the early form of the ceremony at Rome. The emperor
was met at the silver door of St Peter&rsquo;s, where the first coronation
prayer was recited over him by the bishop of Albano. He was then
conducted within the church, where in <i>medio rotae majoris</i>, the
bishop Of Porto said the second prayer. Thence the emperor
went to the confessio of St Peter, where the litany was said, and
there, or before the altar of St Maurice, the bishop of Ostia
anointed him on the right arm and between the shoulders. Then
he ascended to the high altar, where the pope delivered the naked
sword to him. This he flourished, and then sheathed in its
scabbard. The pope then delivered the sceptre to the emperor, and
placed the crown on his head. The ceremony was concluded by
the coronation mass said by the pope. The custom of the emperors
going to Rome to be crowned was last observed by Frederick III.
in 1440, and after that the German coronation was alone celebrated.
The form followed was mainly thus: the electors first
met at Frankfort, under the presidency of the elector-archbishop
of Mainz, and, the election having been made, the emperor was led
to the high altar of the cathedral and seated at it. He was then
conducted to a gallery over the entrance to the choir, where,
seating himself with the electors, proclamation was made of the
election, and on a subsequent day the coronation took place.
If the coronation was performed, as it most commonly was, at
Aix-la-Chapelle, then the archbishop of Cologne, as diocesan, was
the chief officiant, and the emperor was presented to him by the
two other clerical electors, the archbishops of Mainz and Trier.
The emperor was anointed on the head, the nape of the neck, the
breast, the right arm between the wrist and the elbow, and on the
palms of both hands. After this, he was vested in what were
called the imperial and pontifical robes, which included the
buskins, a long alb, the stole crossed priest-wise over the breast,
and the mantle. The regalia were then delivered to him, and the
crown was set on his head conjointly by the three archbishop-electors.
Mass was then said, during which the emperor communicated
in one kind. When the coronation was performed at
Aix-la-Chapelle, the emperor was at once made, at its conclusion,
a canon of the church.</p>

<p>The coronation form in France bore much resemblance, in its
general features, to the English coronation, and was, it is believed
originally based on the English form. The unction was given,
first on the top of the head in the form of a cross, on the breast,
between the shoulders, and at the bending and joints of both arms.
Then, standing up, the king was vested in the dalmatic, tunic and
royal robe, all of purple velvet sprinkled with fleurs-de-lys of gold,
and representing, it was said, the three orders of subdeacon,
deacon and priest. Then, kneeling again, he was anointed in the
palms of the hands, after which the gloves, ring and sceptre were
delivered. Then the peers were summoned by name to come
near and assist, and the archbishop of Reims, taking the crown of
Charlemagne from the altar, set it on the king&rsquo;s head. After
which the enthronement, and showing of the king to the people,
took place. All the unctions were made with the chrism, mixed
with a drop of oil from the Sainte Ampoule. After the enthronement,
mass was said, and at its conclusion the king communicated
in both kinds. The third day after the coronation, the king
touched for the evil.</p>

<p>On the &ldquo;11 Frimaire an 13&rdquo; Napoleon and Josephine were
jointly crowned at Paris, by the pope. Napoleon entered Notre-Dame
wearing a crown, and before him were carried the imperial
ornaments, to wit: <i>&rdquo;la couronne de l&rsquo;empereur, l&rsquo;épée, la main de
justice, le sceptre, le manteau de l&rsquo;empereur, son anneau, son collier,
le globe impérial, la couronne de l&rsquo;impératrice, son manteau, son
anneau.&rdquo;</i> Each of these was blessed, and delivered with a
benediction to the emperor and empress, kneeling, side by side, to
receive them, both having previously received the unction on the
head and on each hand. Napoleon placed the crown on his
head himself. Mass with special prayers followed.</p>

<p>In Spain the coronation ceremony never assumed the fullness,
or magnificence, that might have been expected. It was usually
performed at Toledo, or in the church of St Jerome at Madrid, the
king being anointed by the archbishop of Toledo. The royal
ornaments were the sword, sceptre, crown of gold and the apple
of gold, which the king himself assumed after the unction. In
recent years the unction and coronation have been disused.</p>

<p>In Sweden the king was anointed and crowned at Upsala by the
archbishop. The ceremony is now performed in the Storkyrka,
at Stockholm, where the archbishop of Upsala anoints the king on
the breast, temples, forehead and palms of both hands. The
crown is placed on the king&rsquo;s head by the archbishop and the
minister of justice jointly, whereupon the state marshal proclaims:
&ldquo;Now is crowned king of the Swedes, Goths and Wends,
he and no other.&rdquo; When there is a queen consort, she is then
anointed, crowned and proclaimed, in the same manner.</p>

<p>In Norway, according to the law of 1814, the coronation is
performed in the cathedral at Trondhjem, when the Lutheran
superintendent, or bishop, anoints the king. The crown is
placed on the king&rsquo;s head jointly by the bishop and the prime
minister.</p>

<p>In Russia the coronation is celebrated at Moscow, and is full of
religious significance. The tsar is anointed by the metropolitan,
but places the crown on his head himself. He receives the
sacrament among the clergy, the priestly theory of his office being
recognized. In some other European countries the coronation
ceremony, as in Austria and Hungary, is also performed with
much significant ritual. In other countries, as Prussia, it is
retained in a modified form; but in the remaining states such as
Denmark, Belgium, Italy, &amp;c., it has been abandoned, or never
introduced.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORONER,<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> an ancient officer of the English common law,
so called, according to Coke, because he was a <i>keeper</i> of the pleas
of the crown (<i>custos placitorum coronae</i>). At what period the
office of coroner was instituted is a matter of considerable doubt;
some modern authorities (Stubbs, <i>Select Charters</i>, 260; Pollock
and Maitland, <i>Hist. Eng. Law</i>, i. 519) date its origin from 1194,
but C. Gross (<i>Political Science Quarterly</i>, vol. vii.) has shown
that it must have existed before that date. The office was always
elective, the appointment being made by the freeholders of the
county assembled in county court. By the Statute of Westminster
the First it was ordered that none but lawful and discreet
knights should be chosen as coroners, and in one instance a
person was actually removed from office for insufficiency of
estate. Lands to the value of £20 per annum (the qualification
for knighthood) were afterwards deemed sufficient to satisfy
the requirements as to estate which ought to be insisted on in
the case of a coroner. The complaint of Blackstone shows the
transition of the office from its original dignified and honorary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
character to a paid appointment in the public service, &ldquo;Now,
indeed, through the culpable neglect of gentlemen of property,
this office has been suffered to fall into disrepute, and get into
low and indigent hands; so that, although formerly no coroners
would condescend to be paid for serving their country, and they
were by the aforesaid Statute of Westminster expressly forbidden
to take a reward, under pain of a great forfeiture to the king;
yet for many years past they have only desired to be chosen
for their perquisites; being allowed fees for their attendance
by the statute 3 Henry VII. c. 1, which Sir Edward Coke complains
of heavily; though since his time those fees have been
much enlarged.&rdquo; The mercenary character of the office, thus
deprecated by Coke and Blackstone, is now firmly established,
without, however (it need hardly be said), affording the slightest
ground for such reflections as the above. The coroner is in fact a
public officer, and like other public officers receives payment for
his services. The person appointed is almost invariably a qualified
legal or medical practitioner; how far one is a more &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;
than another has frequently been a matter of dispute&mdash;a Bill
of 1879, which, however, failed to pass, decided in favour of
the legal profession. The property qualification for a county
coroner (&ldquo;having land in fee sufficient in the same county
whereof he may answer to all manner of people,&rdquo; 14 Ed. III.
st. 1, c. 8), although re-enacted in the Coroners Act 1887, is now
virtually dispensed with. The appointment is for life, but is
vacated by the holder being made sheriff. A coroner may be
removed by the writ <i>de coronatore exonerando</i>, for sufficient
cause assigned, or the lord chancellor may, if he thinks fit, remove
any coroner from his office for inability or misbehaviour in the
discharge of his duty.</p>

<p>Coroners are of three kinds: (1) coroners by virtue of their
office, e.g. the lord chief justice of the king&rsquo;s bench is the principal
coroner of England; the puisne judges of the king&rsquo;s bench are
sovereign coroners&mdash;they may exercise their jurisdiction within
any part of the realm, even in the verge<a name="FnAnchor_1j" id="FnAnchor_1j" href="#Footnote_1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> or other exempt
liberties or franchises; (2) coroners by charter or commission,
e.g. in certain liberties and franchises coroners are appointed
by the crown or by lords holding a charter from the crown;
(3) coroners by virtue of election, e.g. county and borough
coroners. County coroners in England were, until 1888, elected
by the freeholders, but by the Local Government Act 1888 the
appointment was given to the county council, who may appoint
any fit person, not being a county alderman or county councillor,
to fill the office. By an act of 1860 the system of payment by
fees, established by an act of 1843, was abolished and payment
made by salary calculated on the average amount of the fees,
mileage, and allowances usually received by the coroner for a
period of five years, and the calculation revised every five years.
In boroughs having a separate court of quarter sessions, and
whose population exceeds 10,000, the coroner is appointed by
the town council and is paid by fees. A county coroner must
reside within his district or not more than two miles out of it.
Deputy coroners are also appointed in both counties and boroughs,
and the law relating to their appointment is contained in the
Coroners Act 1892. The duties of a coroner were ascertained
by 4 Edward I. st. 2:&mdash;&ldquo;A coroner of our Lord the king ought
to inquire of these things, first, when coroners are commanded
by the king&rsquo;s bailiffs or by the honest men of the county, they
shall go to the places where any be slain, or suddenly dead or
wounded, or where houses are broken, or where treasure is said
to be found, and shall forthwith command four of the next
towns, or five, or six, to appear before him in such a place; and
when they are come thither, the coroner upon the oath of them
shall inquire in this manner, that is, to wit, if it concerns a man
slain, if they know when the person was slain, whether it were
in any house, field, bed, tavern, or company, and if any, and
who, were there, &amp;c. It shall also be inquired if the dead person
were known, or else a stranger, and where he lay the night before.
And if any person is said to be guilty of the murder, the coroner
shall go to their house and inquire what goods they have, &amp;c.&rdquo;
Similar directions were given for cases of persons found drowned
or suddenly dead, for attachment of criminals in cases of violence,
&amp;c. His functions are now, by the Coroners Act 1887, limited
to an inquiry upon &ldquo;the dead body of a person lying within his
jurisdiction, where there is reasonable cause to suspect that such
person has died either a violent or an unnatural death, or has
died a sudden death of which the cause is unknown, or that such
person has died in prison, or in such place or under such circumstances
as to require an inquest in pursuance of any act&rdquo; (S. 3),
and upon treasure-trove (S. 36). The inquisition must be
<i>super visum corporis</i> (that is, after &ldquo;viewing the body&rdquo;); the
evidence is taken on oath; and any party suspected may tender
evidence. The Coroners Act 1887, S. 21, gives power to the
coroner to summon medical witnesses and to direct the performance
of a post-mortem examination. The verdict must
be that of twelve at least of the jury. If any person is found
guilty of murder or other homicide, the coroner shall commit
him to prison for trial; he shall also certify the material evidence
to the court, and bind over the proper persons to prosecute or
to give evidence at the trial. He may in his discretion accept
bail for a person found guilty of manslaughter. Since the abolition
of public executions, the coroner is required to hold an
inquest on the body of any criminal on whom sentence of death
has been carried into effect. The duty of coroners to inquire
into treasure-trove (q.v.) is still preserved by the Coroners Act
1887, which, however, repealed certain other jurisdictions, as,&mdash;inquests
of royal fish (whale, sturgeon) thrown ashore or caught
near the coast; inquest of wrecks, and of felonies, except felonies
on inquisitions of death. By the City of London Fire Inquests
Act 1888 the duty is imposed upon the coroner for the city to
hold inquests in cases of loss or injury by fire in the city of London
and the liberties thereof situated in the county of Middlesex.
This is a practice which exists in several European countries.</p>

<p>In Scotland the duties of a coroner are performed by an officer
called a procurator-fiscal.</p>

<p>In the United States and in most of the colonies of Great
Britain the duties of a coroner are substantially the same. In
some cases his duties are more enlarged, his inquisition embracing
the origin of fires; in others they are confined to holding
inquests in cases of suspicious deaths. Unlike a coroner in
England, he is elected generally only for a specified period.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COROT, JEAN-BAPTISTE CAMILLE<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (1796-1875), French
landscape painter, was born in Paris, in a house on the Quai by the
rue du Bac, now demolished, on the 26th of July 1796. His
family were well-to-do bourgeois people, and whatever may have
been the experience of some of his artistic colleagues, he never,
throughout his life, felt the want of money. He was educated at
Rouen and was afterwards apprenticed to a draper, but hated
commercial life and despised what he called its &ldquo;business tricks,&rdquo;
yet he faithfully remained in it until he was twenty-six, when his
father at last consented to his adopting the profession of art.
Corot learned little from his masters. He visited Italy on three
occasions: two of his Roman studies are now in the Louvre.
He was a regular contributor to the Salon during his lifetime, and
in 1846 was &ldquo;decorated&rdquo; with the cross of the Legion of Honour.
He was promoted to be officer in 1867. His many friends
considered nevertheless that he was officially neglected, and in
1874, only a short time before his death, they presented him with
a gold medal. He died in Paris, on the 22nd of February 1875,
and was buried at Père Lachaise.</p>

<p>Of the painters classed in the Barbizon school it is probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
that Corot will live the longest, and will continue to occupy the
highest position. His art is more individual than Rousseau&rsquo;s,
whose works are more strictly traditional; more poetic than that
of Daubigny, who is, however, Corot&rsquo;s greatest contemporary
rival; and in every sense more beautiful than J. F. Millet, who
thought more of stern truth than of aesthetic feeling.</p>

<p>Corot&rsquo;s works are somewhat arbitrarily divided into periods,
but the point of division is never certain, as he often completed a
picture years after it had been begun. In his first style he
painted traditionally and &ldquo;tight&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, with minute
exactness, clear outlines, and with absolute definition of objects
throughout. After his fiftieth year his methods changed to
breadth of tone and an approach to poetic power, and about
twenty years later, say from 1865 onwards, his manner of
painting became full of &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; and poetry. In the last ten
years of his work he became the Père Corot of the artistic circles
of Paris, in which he was regarded with personal affection, and he
was acknowledged as one of the five or six greatest landscape
painters the world has ever seen, along with Hobbema, Claude,
Turner and Constable. During the last few years of his life he
earned large sums by his pictures, which became greatly sought
after. In 1871 he gave £2000 for the poor of Paris (where he
remained during the siege), and his continued charity was long
the subject of remark. Besides landscapes, of which he painted
several hundred, Corot produced a number of figure pictures
which are much prized. These were mostly studio pieces,
executed probably with a view to keep his hand in with severe
drawing, rather than with the intention of producing pictures.
Yet many of them are fine in composition, and in all cases the
colour is remarkable for its strength and purity. Corot also
executed a few etchings and pencil sketches. In his landscape
pictures Corot was more traditional in his method of work than is
usually believed. If even his latest tree-painting and arrangement
are compared with such a Claude as that which hangs in the
Bridgewater gallery, it will be observed how similar is Corot&rsquo;s
method and also how masterly are his results.</p>

<p>The works of Corot are scattered over France and the Netherlands,
Great Britain and America. The following may be
considered as the first half-dozen: &ldquo;Une Matinée&rdquo; (1850), now in
the Louvre; &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; (1859), in the Wallace collection: &ldquo;Le
Lac&rdquo; (1861); &ldquo;L&rsquo;Arbre brisé&rdquo; (1865): &ldquo;Pastorale&mdash;Souvenir
d&rsquo;Italie&rdquo; (1873), in the Glasgow Corporation Art Gallery;
&ldquo;Biblis&rdquo; (1875). Corot had a number of followers who called
themselves his pupils. The best known are Boudin, Lepine,
Chintreuil, Français and Le Roux.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORPORAL.<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> 1. (From Lat. <i>corporalis</i>, belonging to the
<i>corpus</i> or body), an adjective appearing in several expressions,
such as &ldquo;corporal punishment&rdquo; (see below), or in &ldquo;corporal
works of mercy,&rdquo; for those acts confined to the succouring of the
bodily needs, such as feeding the hungry, visiting the sick,
rescuing captives. A &ldquo;corporal oath&rdquo; was sworn with the body
in contact with a sacred object (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oath</a></span>).</p>

<p>2. (From Lat. <i>corporalis</i>, sc. <i>palla</i>, or <i>corporale</i>, sc. <i>pallium</i>), in
the Roman Catholic Church, a small square linen cloth, which at
the service of the Mass is placed on the altar under the chalice and
paten. It was originally large enough to cover the whole surface
of the altar, and was folded over so as to cover the chalice&mdash;a
custom still observed by the Carthusians. The chalice is now,
however, covered by another small square of linen, stiffened with
cardboard, &amp;c., known as the pall (<i>palla</i>). When not in use both
corporal and pall are carried in a square silken pocket called the
burse. The corporal must be blessed by the bishop, or by a priest
with special faculties, the ritual prayers invoking the divine
blessing that the linen may be worthy to cover and enwrap the
body and blood of the Lord. It represents the winding-sheet in
which Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of the dead
Christ.</p>

<p>3. (Of uncertain derivation; the French form <i>caporal</i>, and
Ital. <i>caporale</i>, point to an origin from <i>capo</i>, Italian for head; the
<i>New English Dictionary</i>, however, favours the derivation from
Lat. <i>corpus</i>, Ital. <i>corpo</i>, body), a non-commissioned officer of
infantry, cavalry and artillery, ranking below a sergeant. This
rank is almost universal in armies. In the 16th and 17th centuries
there were corporals but no sergeants in the cavalry, and this
custom is preserved in the three regiments of British household
cavalry, the rank of sergeant being replaced by that of &ldquo;corporal
of horse,&rdquo; and that of sergeant-major by &ldquo;corporal-major.&rdquo; In
the 16th and early 17th centuries the title &ldquo;corporal of the field&rdquo;
was often given to a superior officer who acted as a staff-officer to
the sergeant-major-general. In the navy the &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s corporal,&rdquo;
formerly a semi-military instructor to the crew, is now a petty
officer charged with assisting the master-at-arms in police duties
on board ship.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORPORAL PUNISHMENT,<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> chastisement inflicted by one
person on the body (<i>corpus</i>) of another. By the common law of
England, Scotland and Ireland, the infliction of corporal punishment
is illegal unless it is done in self-defence or in defence of
others, or is done either by some person having punitive authority
over the person chastised or under the authority of a competent
court of justice. Corporal punishment in defence of self or
others needs no comment, except that, like all other acts done in
defence, its justification depends on whether or not it was
reasonably necessary for the protection of the person attacked.
Among persons invested with punitive authority, mention must
first be made of parents and guardians, and of teachers, who
have, by implied delegation from the parents, and as incidental
to the relation of master and pupil, powers of reasonable corporal
punishment. Such powers are not limited to offences committed
by the pupil upon the premises of the school, but extend to acts
done on the way to and from school and during what may be
properly regarded as school hours (<i>Cleary</i> v. <i>Booth</i>, 1893, 1
Q.B. 465). The rights of parents, guardians and teachers, in
regard to the chastisement of children, were expressly recognized
in English law by the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act 1904
(§ 28). Poor law authorities and managers of reformatories are in
the same position in this respect as teachers. The punitive
authority of elementary school teachers is subject to the regulations
of the education authority: that of poor law authorities to
the regulation of the Home Office and the Local Government
Board. A master has a right to inflict moderate chastisement
upon his apprentice for neglect or other misbehaviour, provided
that he does so himself, and that the apprentice is under age
(Archbold, <i>Cr. Pl.</i>, 23rd ed., 795). Where a legal right of chastisement
is exercised immoderately, the person so exercising it incurs
both civil and criminal liability.</p>

<p>In some of the older English legal authorities (e.g. Bacon,
Abridg. tit. &ldquo;Baron and Feme,&rdquo; B), it was stated that a husband
might inflict moderate corporal punishment on his wife in order
to keep her &ldquo;within the bounds of duty.&rdquo; But these authorities
were definitely discredited in 1891 in the case of <i>R.</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>
(1 Q.B. 671). By the unmodified Mahommedan law, a husband
may administer moderate corporal punishment to his wife; but
it is doubtful whether this right could be legally exercised in
British India (Wilson, <i>Digest of Anglo-Mahommedan Law</i>, 2nd ed.,
pp. 153, 154). In Hawkins&rsquo;s <i>Pleas of the Crown</i> (Bk. 1, c. 63,
§ 29) it is laid down that &ldquo;churchwardens, and perhaps private
persons, may whip boys playing in church&rdquo; during divine
service. But while the right to remove such offenders is undoubted,
the right of castigation could not now safely be
exercised. At common law the master of a ship is entitled to
inflict reasonable chastisement on a seaman for gross breach of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
duty. But such offences are now specially provided for by the
Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (§§ 220-238); and where the
provisions of that statute are available, corporal punishment
would probably be illegal.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As to corporal punishment in the army and navy, see articles
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Military Law</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Navy</a></span>. In civil prisons, whether they are convict
prisons or local prisons, corporal punishment may not be inflicted
except under sentence of a competent court, or except in the case
of prisoners under sentence of penal servitude, or convicted of
felony, or sentenced to hard labour, who have been guilty of mutiny
or incitement to mutiny, or of gross personal violence to an officer
or servant of the prison (Act of 1898, § 5). Flogging for these offences
in prison may not be inflicted except by order of the board of visitors
or visiting committee of the prison, made at a meeting specially
constituted, and confirmed by a secretary of state (Prison Act of
1898, § 5; Convict Prison Rules 1899; Stat. R. and O. 1899, No.
321, rr. 77-79; Local Prison Rules 1899; Stat. R. and O. 1899, No.
322, rr. 84, 85). The mode of inflicting the punishment is prescribed
by the Convict Prison Rules (rr. 82-85) and the Local Prison Rules
(rr. 88-91), which limit the number of strokes and prescribe the
instrument to be used for inflicting them, the cat or birch for prisoners
over 18, and the birch for prisoners under 18.</p>

<p>Corporal punishment for breaches of prison discipline in Scottish
prisons is not authorized by any statute nor under the Scottish Prison
Rules (see <i>Stat. R. and O. Revised</i>, ed. 1904, vol. X. tit. &ldquo;Prison,
Scotland,&rdquo; p. 60). In Irish convict prisons corporal punishment
may be inflicted by order of justices specially appointed by the lord-lieutenant
under § 3 of the Penal Servitude Act 1864, but the Irish
Prison Rules of 1902 (Stat. R. and O. 1902, No. 590) contain no reference
to this power.</p>

<p>At common law, courts of justice had jurisdiction to impose a
sentence of whipping on persons convicted on indictment for
petty larceny or misdemeanours of the meaner kind (see 1
Bishop, <i>Amer. Cr. Law</i>, 8th ed., § 942). But they do not now
impose such sentence except under statutory authority. The
whipping of women was absolutely prohibited in 1820 by the
Whipping of Female Offenders Abolition Act of that year. But
there are numerous statutes authorizing the imposition of a
sentence of whipping on male offenders. The following cases
may be noted. 1. <i>Adults</i>: (a) who are incorrigible rogues
(Vagrancy Act 1824, § 10); (b) who discharge fire-arms, &amp;c., with
intent to injure or alarm the sovereign (Treason Act 1842, § 2,
and see 8 St. Tr. N.S. 1, and <i>O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s Case</i>, 1872, ib. p. 3 n.);
(c) who are guilty of robbery with violence (Larceny Act 1861,
§ 43), or offences against § 21 of the Offences against the Person
Act of 1861; there has been much controversy as to whether
the Garrotters Act of 1861, which authorized the ordering of more
than one whipping in the case of an offender over 16 years of
age, was the effective cause of the diminution of the offences
against which it was directed, but the best judicial opinion is in
the affirmative. 2. <i>Males under sixteen</i>: (a) in any of the cases
above noted; (b) for many statutory offences, e.g. larceny
(Larceny Act 1861), malicious damage (Malicious Damage Act
1861, § 75; Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, § 4); (c) by
courts of summary jurisdiction (Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879,
§§ 10, 11, and 1899; First Offenders Act 1887); if a boy is over
7 and under 12, not more than 6 strokes, if he is over 12, but under
14, not more than 12 strokes may be inflicted; the birch-rod is
to be used, and the punishment is to be given by a police
constable in the presence of a superior officer, and of the parent or
guardian if he desire it.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In Scotland the whipping of male offenders under 14 is regulated
by the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1860, § 74, the Whipping Act 1862,
and § 514 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892; and offenders
over 16 may not be whipped for offences against person or property
(Whipping Act 1862, § 2).</p>

<p>In Ireland the law is in substance the same as in England; for
special statutes see official <i>Index to Statutes</i> (ed. 1905), p. 985, art.
Punishment, 6.</p>

<p>The flogging of women is prohibited throughout British India
(Code of Criminal Procedure, Act v. of 1898, § 393) and the British
colonies, where the infliction of corporal punishment by judicial
order is in the main regulated on the lines of modern English legislation.
In some British colonies the list of offences punishable by
whipping is larger than in England (see Queensland Criminal Code
1899, arts. 212, 213, 216).</p>
</div>

<p>In the United States whipping is not a legal punishment under
the Federal Law (Revised Stats. U.S. § 5327). But in some of the
states of the Union whipping is inflicted under statute, and is not
held cruel or unusual within the Federal Constitution (1 Bishop,
<i>Amer. Crim. Law</i>, 8th ed., § 947). In Delaware wife-beating and
certain offences against property by males are punishable with
flogging; and in Maryland the same punishment is applicable
for wife-beating. Flogging is in force as a disciplinary measure
in some penal institutions.</p>

<p>It has been suggested by Laurent (<i>Principes de droit civil
français</i> (1870), vol. iv. § 275) that the express definition in the
French Code Civil (arts. 371 et seq.) of parental rights over
children excludes the power of corporal punishment. But this
view is not generally accepted. The parental right of moderate
chastisement is expressly reserved in the Civil Code of Spain
(art. 155, 2). Flogging is not recognized as a legal punishment
by the French Code Pénal, nor by the Penal Codes
of Germany, Italy, Spain or Portugal. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Whipping

<p><span class="bold">CORPORATION<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>corporare</i>, to form into a body,
<i>corpus</i>, <i>corporis</i>), in English law, an association of persons which
is treated in many respects as if it were itself a person. It has
rights and duties of its own which are not the rights and duties of
the individual members thereof. Thus a corporation may own
land, but the individual members of the corporation have no
rights therein. A corporation may owe money, but the
corporators as individuals are under no obligation to pay the
debt. The rights and duties descend to the successive members
of the corporation. This capacity of perpetual succession is
regarded as the distinguishing feature of corporations as compared
with other societies. One of the phrases most commonly
met with in law-books describes a corporation as a society with
perpetual succession and a common seal. The latter point,
however, is not conclusive of the corporate character.</p>

<p>The legal attributes of a corporation have been worked out
with great fulness and ingenuity in English law, but the conception
has been taken full-grown from the law of Rome. The
term in Roman law corresponding to the modern corporation is
<i>collegium</i>; a more general term is <i>universitas</i>. A <i>collegium</i> or
<i>corpus</i> must have consisted of at least three persons, who were
said to be <i>corporati&mdash;habere corpus</i>. They could hold property in
common and had a common chest. They might sue and be sued
by their agent (<i>syndicus</i> or <i>actor</i>). There was a complete separation
in law between the rights of the <i>collegium</i> as a body and
those of its individual members. The <i>collegium</i> remained in
existence although all its original members were changed. It
was governed by its own by-laws, provided these were not
contrary to the common law. The power of forming <i>collegia</i> was
restrained, and societies pretending to act as corporations were
often suppressed. In all these points the <i>collegia</i> of Roman
closely resemble the corporations of English law. There is a
similar parallel between the purposes for which the formation of
such societies is authorized in English and in Roman law. Thus
among the Roman <i>collegia</i> the following classes are distinguished:&mdash;(1)
Public governing bodies, or municipalities, <i>civitates</i>;
(2) religious societies, such as the <i>collegia</i> of priests and Vestal
Virgins; (3) official societies, e.g. the <i>scribae</i>, employed in the
administration of the state; (4) trade societies, e.g. <i>fabri</i>, <i>pictores</i>,
<i>navicularii</i>, &amp;c. This class shades down into the <i>societates</i> not
incorporated, just as our own trading corporations partake
largely of the character of ordinary partnerships. In the later
Roman law the distinction of corporations into civil and ecclesiastical,
into lay and eleemosynary, is recognized. The latter
could not alienate without just cause, nor take land without
a licence&mdash;a restriction which may be compared with modern
statutes of mortmain. All these privileged societies are what we
should call <i>corporations aggregate</i>. The <i>corporation sole</i> (i.e. consisting
of only a single person) is a later refinement, for although
Roman law held that the corporation subsisted in full force,
notwithstanding that only one member survived, it did not
impute to the successive holders of a public office the character
of a corporation. When a public officer in English law is said to
be a corporation sole, the meaning is that the rights acquired by
him in that capacity descend to his successor in office, and not
(as the case is where a public officer is not a corporation) to his
ordinary legal representative. The best known instances of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
corporation sole are the king and the parson of a parish. The
conception of the king as a corporation is the key to many of his
paradoxical attributes in constitutional theory&mdash;his invisibility,
immortality, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The term <i>quasi-corporation</i> is applied to holders for the time
being of certain official positions, though not incorporated, as
the churchwardens of a parish, guardians of the poor, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Roman conception of a corporation was kept alive by
ecclesiastical and municipal bodies. When English lawyers
came to deal with such societies, the corporation law of Rome
admitted of easy application. Accordingly, in no department
has English law borrowed so copiously and so directly from the
civil law. The corporations known to the earlier English law
were mainly the municipal, the ecclesiastical, and the educational
and eleemosynary. To all of these the same principles, borrowed
from Roman jurisprudence, were applied. The different purposes
of these institutions brought about in course of time differences
in the rules of the law applicable to each. In particular, the
great development of trading companies under special statutes
has produced a new class of corporations, differing widely from
those formerly known to the law. The reform of municipal
corporations has also restricted the operation of the principles of
the older corporation law. These principles, however, still
apply when special statutes have not intervened.</p>

<p>The legal origin of corporation is ascribed by J. Grant (<i>Treatise
on the Law of Corporations</i>, 1850) to five sources, viz. common
law, prescription, act of parliament, charter and implication.
Prescription in legal theory implies a grant, so that corporations
by prescription would be reducible to the class of chartered or
statutory corporations. A corporation is said to exist by implication
when the purposes of a legally constituted society cannot be
carried out without corporate powers. Corporations are thus
ultimately traceable to the authority of charters and acts of
parliament. The power of creating corporations by charter is an
important prerogative of the crown, but in the present state of
the constitution, when all the powers of the crown are practically
exercised by parliament, there is no room for any jealousy as to
the manner in which it may be exercised. The power of chartering
corporations belonged also to subjects who had <i>jura regalia</i>,
e.g. the bishops of Durham granted a charter of incorporation to
the city of Durham in 1565, 1602 and 1780. The charter of a
corporation is regarded as being of the nature of a contract
between the king and the corporation. It will be construed
more favourably for the crown, and more strictly as against the
grantee. It cannot alter the law of the land, and it may be
surrendered, so that, if the surrender is accepted by the crown
and enrolled in chancery, the corporation is thereby dissolved.
Great use was made of this power of the crown in the reigns
of Charles II. and James II.</p>

<p>Every corporation, it is said, must have a name, and it may
have more names than one, but two corporations cannot have
the same name. And corporations cannot change their name
save by charter or some equivalent authority.</p>

<p>The possession of a common seal, though, as already stated,
not conclusive of the corporate character, is an incident of
every corporation aggregate. The inns of courts have common
seals, but they are only voluntary societies, not corporations.
Generally speaking, all corporate acts affecting strangers must
be performed under the common seal; acts of internal administration
affecting only the corporators, need not be under seal. The
rule has been defended as following necessarily from the impersonal
character of a corporation; either a seal or something
equivalent must be fixed upon so that the act of the corporation
may be recognized by all.</p>

<p>A corporation may be abolished by statute, but not by the
mere authority of the crown. It may also become extinct by the
disappearance of all its members or of any integral part, by
surrender of charter if it is a chartered society, by process of
law, or by forfeiture of privileges.</p>

<p>The power of the majority to bind the society is one of
the first principles of corporation law, even in cases where
the corporation has a head. It is even said that only by an
act of parliament can this rule be avoided. The binding
majority is that of the number present at a corporate meeting
duly summoned.</p>

<p>In corporations which have a head (as colleges), although the
head cannot veto the resolution of the majority, he is still
considered an integral part of the society, and his death suspends
its existence, so that a head cannot devise or bequeath to the
corporation, nor can a grant be made to a corporation during
vacancy of the headship.</p>

<p>A corporation has power to make such regulations (by-laws)
as are necessary for carrying out its purposes, and these are
binding on its members and on persons within its local jurisdiction
if it has any.</p>

<p>The power to acquire and hold land was incident to a corporation
at common law, but its restriction by the statutes of mortmain
dates from a very early period. The English law against
mortmain was dictated by the jealousy of the feudal lords, who
lost the services they would otherwise have been entitled to,
when their land passed into the hands of a perpetual corporation.
The vast increase in the estates of ecclesiastical corporations
constituted by itself a danger which might well justify the
operation of the restricting statutes.</p>

<p>The Mortmain Acts applied only to cases of alienation <i>inter
vivos</i>. There was no power to devise lands by will until 32 Henry
VIII. c. 1 (1540), and when the power was granted corporations
were expressly excluded from its benefits. No devise to a
corporation, whether for its own use or in trust, was allowed to
be good; land so devised went to the heir, either absolutely or
charged with the trusts imposed upon it in the abortive devise.
A modification, however, was gradually wrought by the judicial
interpretations of the Charitable Trusts Act 1601, and it was
held that a devise to a corporation for a charitable purpose
might be a good devise, and would stand unless voided by the
Mortmain Acts; so that no corporation could take land, without
a licence, for any purpose or in any way; and no localised
corporation could take lands by devise, save for charitable
purposes. Then came the act of 1736, commonly but improperly
called the Mortmain Act. Its effect was generally to make it
impossible for land to be left by will for charitable uses, whether
through a corporation or a natural person<a name="FnAnchor_1k" id="FnAnchor_1k" href="#Footnote_1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a>. The Wills Act 1837
did not renew the old provision against devises to corporations,
which therefore fell under the general law of mortmain. The law
was consolidated by the Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act 1888,
and the result is simply that corporations cannot take land for any
purpose without a licence, and no licence in mortmain is granted
by the crown, except in certain statutory cases in the interests
of religion, charity or other definite public object.</p>

<p>The power of corporations at common law to alienate their
property is usually restricted, as is their power to lease it for more
than a certain number of years, except by sanction of a public
authority. The more important classes of corporations, however,
are now governed by special statutes which exclude or
modify the operation of the common law principles. The most
considerable class of societies still unaffected by such special
legislation are the Livery Companies (q.v.). Under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Company</a></span>
will be found an account of the important enactments regulating
joint-stock companies.</p>

<p>The question to what extent the common law incidents of a
corporation have been interfered with by special legislation has
become one of much importance, especially under the acts
relating to joint-stock companies. The most important case
on this subject is that of <i>Riche</i> v. <i>The Ashbury Railway Carriage
Company</i>, 1875 (L.R. 9 Ex. 224; L.R. 7 H.L. 653), in which, the
judges of the exchequer chamber being equally divided, the
decision of the court below was affirmed. The view taken by the
affirming judges, viz. that the common law incidents of a corporation
adhere unless expressly removed by the legislature, may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
illustrated by a short extract from the judgment of Mr Justice
Blackburn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;If I thought it was at common law an incident to a corporation
that its capacity should be limited by the instrument creating it, I
should agree that the capacity of a company incorporated under
the act of 1862 was limited to the object in the memorandum of
association. But if I am right in the opinion which I have already
expressed, that the general power of contracting is an incident to a
corporation which it requires an indication of intention in the
legislature to take away, I see no such indication here. If the
question was whether the legislature had conferred on a corporation,
created under this act, capacity to enter into contracts beyond
the provisions of the deed, there could be only one answer. The
legislature did not confer such capacity. But if the question be,
as I apprehend it is, whether the legislature have indicated an
intention to take away the power of contracting which at common
law would be incident to a body corporate, and not merely to limit
the authority of the managing body and the majority of the share-holders
to bind the minority, but also to prohibit and make illegal
contracts made by the body corporate, in such a manner that they
would be binding on the body if incorporated at common law, I
think the answer should be the other way.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, the House of Lords, agreeing with the
three dissentient judges in the exchequer chamber, pronounced
the effect of the Companies Act to be the opposite of that indicated
by Mr Justice Blackburn, &ldquo;It was the intention of the
legislature, not implied, but actually expressed, that the corporations,
should not enter, having regard to this memorandum of
association, into a contract of this description. The contract in
my judgment could not have been ratified by the unanimous
assent of the whole corporation.&rdquo; In such companies, therefore,
objects beyond the scope of the memorandum of association are
<i>ultra vires</i> of the corporation. The doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i>, as it is
called, is almost wholly of modern and judicial creation. The
first emphatic recognition of it appears to have been in the case
of companies created for special purposes with extraordinary
powers, by act of parliament, and, more particularly, railway
companies. The funds of such companies, it was held, must be
applied to the purposes for which they were created, and to no
other. Whether this doctrine is applicable to the older or, as
they are sometimes called, ordinary corporations, appears to be
doubtful. S. Brice (<i>Ultra Vires</i>) writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Take, as a strong instance, a university or a London guild.
Either can undoubtedly manage, invest, transform and expend
the corporate property in almost any way it pleases, but if they
proposed to exhaust the same on the private pleasures of existing
members, or to abandon the promotion, the one of education, the
other of their art and mystery, it is very probable, if not absolutely
certain, that the court of chancery would restrain the same, as
being <i>ultra vires</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1k" id="Footnote_1k" href="#FnAnchor_1k"><span class="fn">1</span></a> Devises to colleges are excepted from the operation of the act,

resembling the original purposes of the college; and the exception

<p><span class="bold">CORPS<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (pronounced as in French, from which it is taken, being
a late spelling of <i>cors</i>, from Lat. <i>corpus</i>, a body; cf. &ldquo;corpse&rdquo;),
a word in very general use since the 17th century to denote a body
of troops, varying from a few hundred to the greater part of an
army. In a special sense &ldquo;corps&rdquo; is used as synonymous with
&ldquo;army corps&rdquo; (<i>corps d&rsquo;armée</i>). The word is applied to any
organized body, as in <i>corps diplomatique</i>, the general body of
foreign diplomatic agents accredited to any government (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diplomacy</a></span>), or <i>corps de ballet</i>, the members of a troop of dancers

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORPSE<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (Lat. <i>corpus</i>, the body), a dead human body. By the
common law of England a corpse is not the subject of property
nor capable of holding property. It is not therefore larceny to
steal a corpse, but any removal of the coffin or grave-cloths is
otherwise, such remaining the property of the persons who
buried the body. It is a misdemeanour to expose a naked corpse
to public view, to prevent the burial of a dead body, or to
disinter it without authority; also to bury or otherwise dispose
of a dead body on which an inquest ought to be held, without
giving notice to a coroner. Anyone who, having the means,
neglects to bury a dead body which he is legally bound to bury,
is guilty of a misdemeanour, but no one is bound to incur a debt
for such a purpose. It is incumbent on the relatives and friends
of a deceased person to provide Christian burial for him; failing
relatives and friends, the duty devolves upon the parish. No
corpse can be attached, taken in execution, arrested or detained
for debt. See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Body-snatching</a></span>, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Burial and

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORPULENCE<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (Lat. <i>corpus</i>, body), or <span class="sc">Obesity</span> (Lat. <i>ob</i>,
against, and <i>edere</i>, to eat), a condition of the animal body
characterized by the over-accumulation of fat under the skin and
around certain of the internal organs. In all healthy persons a
greater or less amount of fat is present in these parts, and serves
important physiological ends, besides contributing to the proper
configuration of the body (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nutrition</a></span>). Even a considerable
measure of fatness, however inconvenient, is not inconsistent
with a high degree of health and activity, and it is only when in
great excess or rapidly increasing that it can be regarded as a
pathological state (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Metabolic Diseases</a></span>). The extent to
which excess of fat may proceed is illustrated by numerous well-authenticated
examples recorded in medical works, of which only
a few can be here mentioned. Thus Bright, a grocer of Maldon,
in Essex, who died in 1750, in his twenty-ninth year, weighed
616 &#8468;. Dr F. Dancel (<i>Traité de l&rsquo;obésité</i>, Paris, 1863) records the
case of a young man of twenty-two, who died from excessive
obesity, weighing 643 &#8468;. In the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for
1813 a case is recorded of a girl of four years of age who weighed
256 &#8468;. But the most celebrated case is that of Daniel Lambert
(q.v.) of Leicester, who died in 1809 in his fortieth year. He is
said to have been the heaviest man that ever lived, his weight
being 739 &#8468; (52 st. 11 &#8468;). Health cannot be long maintained
under excessive obesity, for the increase in bulk of the body,
rendering exercise more difficult, leads to relaxation and defective
nutrition of muscle, while the accumulations of fat in the chest
and abdomen occasion serious embarrassment to the functions of
the various organs in those cavities. In general the mental
activity of the highly corpulent becomes impaired, although
there have always been many notable exceptions to this rule.</p>

<p>Various causes are assigned for the production of corpulence
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Metabolic Diseases</a></span>). In some families there exists an
hereditary predisposition to an obese habit of body, the manifestation
of which no precautions as to living appear capable of
averting. But it is unquestionable that certain habits favour
the occurrence of corpulence. A luxurious, inactive, or sedentary
life, with over-indulgence in sleep and absence of mental occupation,
are well recognized predisposing causes. The more
immediate exciting causes are over-feeding and the large use of
fluids of any kind, but especially alcoholic liquors. Fat persons
are not always great eaters, though many of them are, while
leanness and inordinate appetite are not infrequently associated.
Still, it may be stated generally that indulgence in food, beyond
what is requisite to repair daily waste, goes towards the increase
of flesh, particularly of fat. This is more especially the case
when the non-nitrogenous (the fatty, saccharine and starchy)
elements of the food are in excess. The want of adequate bodily
exercise will in a similar manner produce a like effect, and it is
probable that many cases of corpulence are to be ascribed to this
cause alone, from the well-known facts that many persons of
sedentary occupation become stout, although of most abstemious
habits, and that obesity frequently comes on in the middle-aged
and old, who take relatively less exercise than the young, in
whom it is comparatively rare. Women are more prone to
become corpulent than men, and appear to take on this condition
more readily after the cessation of the function of menstruation.</p>

<p>For the prevention of corpulence and the reduction of superfluous
fat many expedients have been resorted to, and numerous
remedies recommended. These have included bleeding, blistering,
purging, starving (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fasting</a></span>), the use of different kinds of
baths, and of drugs innumerable. The drinking of vinegar was
long popularly, but erroneously, supposed to be a remedy for
obesity. It is related of the marquis of Cortona, a noted general
of the duke of Alva, that by drinking vinegar he so reduced his
body from a condition of enormous obesity that he could fold his
skin about him like a garment.</p>

<p>In 1863 a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Letter on Corpulence, Addressed
to the Public by William Banting,&rdquo; in which was narrated the
remarkable experience of the writer in accomplishing the reduction
of his own weight in a short space of time by the adoption of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
particular kind of diet, started the modern dietetic treatment, at
first called &ldquo;Banting&rdquo; after the author. After trying almost
every known remedy without effect, Banting was induced, on the
suggestion of Mr Harvey, a London aurist, to place himself upon
an entirely new form of diet, which consisted chiefly in the
removal, as far as possible, of all saccharine, starchy and fat food,
the reduction of liquids, and the substitution of meat or fish and
fruit in moderate quantity at each meal, together with the daily
use of an antacid draught. Under this regimen his weight was
reduced 46 &#8468; in the course of a few weeks, while his health
underwent a marked improvement. His experience, as might
have been expected, induced many to follow his example; and
since then various regimens have been propounded, all aiming
at treating corpulence on modern physiological principles (see also

important, however, to bear in mind that the treatment should
be followed under medical advice and observation; for, however

<p><span class="bold">CORPUS CHRISTI,<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Nueces
county, Texas, U.S.A., situated on Corpus Christi Bay opposite
the mouth of the Nueces river, 192 m. W.S.W. of Galveston and
about 150 m. S.S.E. of San Antonio. Pop. (1890) 4387; (1900)
4703, including 963 foreign-born and 460 negroes; (1910) 8299.
It is served by the National of Mexico, the St Louis, Brownsville &amp;
Mexico, and the San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass railways. In 1908
the Federal government began work on a project to connect
Corpus Christi harbour with Aransas Pass by a channel 8½ ft.
deep at low water and 75 ft. wide at the bottom, following a
natural depression between the two bays. Corpus Christi is a
summer and winter resort, with a very dry equable climate
(average annual mean, 70.2° F.) and good bathing on the horseshoe
beach of Corpus Christi Bay. The city has an extensive
coasting trade, and exports fruit, early vegetables, fish and
oysters. There was a small Spanish settlement here at an
early date, but no American settlement was made until after the
Mexican War. Corpus Christi was the base from which General
Zachary Taylor made his forward movement to the Rio Grande
in 1846. It was chartered as a city in 1876.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORPUS CHRISTI, FEAST OF<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> (Lat. <i>festum corporis Christi</i>,
i.e. festival of the Body of Christ, Fr. <i>fête-Dieu</i> or <i>fête du sacrement</i>,
Ger. <i>Frohnleichnamsfest</i>), a festival of the Roman Catholic
Church in honour of the Real Presence of Christ in the sacrament
of the altar, observed on the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday.
The doctrine of transubstantiation was defined by the Lateran
Council in 1215, and shortly afterwards the elevation and adoration
of the Host were formally enjoined. This naturally stimulated
the popular devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, which had
been already widespread before the definition of the dogma.
The movement was especially strong in the diocese of Liége, and
when Julienne, prioress of Mont-Cornillon near Liége (1222-1258),
had a vision in which the need for the establishment of a
festival in honour of the Sacrament was revealed to her, the
matter was taken up with enthusiasm by the clergy, and in 1246
Robert de Torote, bishop of Liége, instituted such a festival for
his diocese. The idea, however, did not spread until, in 1261,
Jacob Pantaleon, archdeacon of Liége, ascended the papal
throne as Urban IV. By a bull of 1264 Urban made the festival,
hitherto practically confined to the diocese of Liége, obligatory on
the whole Church,<a name="FnAnchor_1l" id="FnAnchor_1l" href="#Footnote_1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and a new office for the festival was written
by Thomas Aquinas himself. As yet the stress was laid on
reverence for the Holy Sacrament as a whole; there is no mention
in Urban&rsquo;s bull of the solemn procession and exposition of the
Host for the adoration of the faithful, which are the main
features of the festival as at present celebrated. Urban&rsquo;s bull
was once more promulgated, at the council of Vienne in 1311, by
Pope Clement V.; and the procession of the Host in connexion
with the festival was instituted, if the accounts we possess are
trustworthy, by Pope John XXII.</p>

<p>From this time onwards the festival increased in popularity
and in splendour. It became in effect the principal feast of the
Church, the procession of the Sacrament a gorgeous pageant, in
which not only the members of the trade and craft gilds, with
the magistrates of the cities, took part, but princes and
sovereigns. It thus became in a high degree symbolical of the
exaltation of the sacerdotal power.<a name="FnAnchor_2l" id="FnAnchor_2l" href="#Footnote_2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In the 15th century the
custom became almost universal of following the procession with
the performance of miracle-plays and mysteries, generally
arranged and acted by members of the gilds who had formed
part of the pageant.</p>

<p>The rejection of the doctrine of transubstantiation at the
Reformation naturally involved the suppression of the festival of
Corpus Christi in the reformed Churches. Luther, in spite of his
belief in the Real Presence, regarded it as the most harmful of all
the medieval festivals and, though he fully realized its popularity,
it was the first that he abolished. This attitude of the reformers
towards the festival, however, intensified by their abhorrence of
the traffic in indulgences with which it had become closely
associated, only tended to establish it more firmly among the
adherents of the &ldquo;old religion.&rdquo; The procession of the Host on
Corpus Christi day became, as it were, a public demonstration of
Catholic orthodoxy against Protestantism and later against
religious Liberalism. In most countries where religious opinion
is sharply divided the procession of Corpus Christi is therefore
now forbidden, even when Catholicism is the dominant religion.
In England occasional breaches of the law in this respect have
been for some time tolerated, as in the case of the Corpus Christi
procession annually held by the Italian community in London.
An attempt to hold a public procession of the Host in connexion
with the Eucharistic Congress at Westminster in 1908, however,
was the signal for the outburst of a considerable amount of
opposition, and was eventually abandoned owing to the personal
intervention of the prime minister.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1l" id="Footnote_1l" href="#FnAnchor_1l"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The pope&rsquo;s decision, so the story goes, was hastened by a miracle.
A priest, saying mass at the church of Santa Christina at Bolsena,
was troubled, after the consecration, with grave doubts as to the
truth of the doctrine of transubstantiation. His temptation was
removed by the Host beginning to bleed, the blood soaking through
the corporal <i>into</i> the marble of the altar.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2l" id="Footnote_2l" href="#FnAnchor_2l"><span class="fn">2</span></a> Nothing caused more offence to Liberal sentiment in France after
the Restoration than the spectacle of King Louis XVIII. walking

<p><span class="bold">CORRAL<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> (Span. from <i>corro</i>, a circle), a word used chiefly in
Spanish America and the United States for an enclosure for
cattle and horses, and also for a defensive circle formed of
wagons against attacks from Indians. It is also used as a verb,
meaning to drive into a corral, and so figuratively to enclose,
hem in. The word is probably connected with the South African
Dutch word kraal (q.v.). In Ceylon it is especially used for an
enclosure meant for the capture of wild elephants. In this last

<p><span class="bold">CORREA,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> a genus of Australian plants belonging to the
natural order Rutaceae, named after the Portuguese botanist
José Francisco Correa da Serra. The plants are evergreen shrubs
and extremely useful for winter flowering. They are increased by
cuttings, and grown in a cool greenhouse in rough peaty soil,
with a slight addition of loam and sand. After the plants have
done flowering, they should all get a little artificial warmth,
plenty of moisture, and a slight shade, while they are making
their growth, during which period the tips of the young shoots
should be nipped out when 6 or 8 in. long. When the growth is
complete, a half-shady place outdoors during August and
September will be suitable, with protection from parching winds
and hot sunshine.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORREA DA SERRA, JOSÉ FRANCISCO<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (1750-1823),
Portuguese politician and man of science, was born at Serpa, in
Alemtejo, in 1750. Educated at Rome, he took orders under the
protection of the duke of Alafoès, uncle of Mary I. of Portugal.
In 1777 he returned to Lisbon, where he resided with his patron,
with whose assistance he founded the Portuguese Academy of
Sciences. Of this institution he was named perpetual secretary,
and he received the privilege of publishing its transactions
without reference to any censor whatever. His use of
this right brought him into conflict with the Holy Office; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
consequently in 1786 he fled to France, and remained there till
the death of Pedro III., when he again took up his residence
with Alafoès. But having given a lodging in the palace to a
French Girondist, he was forced to flee to England, where he
found a protector in Sir Joseph Banks, and became a member
of the Royal Society. In 1797 he was appointed secretary to the
Portuguese embassy, but a quarrel with the ambassador drove
him once more to Paris (1802), and in that city he resided till
1813, when he crossed over to New York. In 1816 he was made
Portuguese minister-plenipotentiary at Washington, and in 1820
he was recalled home, appointed a member of the financial
council, and elected to a seat in the Cortes. Three years after,
and in the same year with the fall of the constitutional government,
he died. Correa da Serra ranks high as a botanist, though
he published no great special work. His principal claim to
renown is the <i>Colecção de livros ineditos da historia Portugueza</i>,
(4 vols., 1790-1816), an invaluable selection of documents,
exceedingly well edited.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORREGGIO,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Coreggio</span>, the name ordinarily given to
Antonio Allegri (1494-1534), the celebrated Italian painter, one
of the most vivid and impulsive inventors in expression and pose
and the most consummate executants. The external circumstances
of his life have been very diversely stated by different
writers, and the whole of what has been narrated regarding him,
even waiving the question of its authenticity, is but meagre.</p>

<p>The first controversy is as to his origin. Some say that he was
born of poor and lowly parents; others, that his family was noble
and rich. Neither account is accurate. His father was Pellegrino
Allegri, a tradesman in comfortable circumstances, living
at Correggio, a small city in the territory of Modena; his mother
Bernardina Piazzoli degli Aromani, also of a creditable family of
moderate means. Antonio was born at Correggio, and was
carefully educated. He was not (as has been often alleged)
strictly self-taught in his art&mdash;a supposition which the internal
evidence of his pictures must of itself refute. They show a
knowledge of optics, perspective, architecture, sculpture and
anatomy. The last-named science he studied under Dr Giovanni
Battista Lombardi, whom he is believed to have represented in
the portrait currently named &ldquo;II Medico del Correggio&rdquo;
(Correggio&rsquo;s physician). It is concluded that he learned the first
elements of design from his uncle, Lorenzo Allegri, a painter of
moderate ability at Correggio, and from Antonio Bartolotti,
named Tognino, and that he afterwards went to the school of
Francesco Ferrari Bianchi (named Frarè), and perhaps to that of
the successors of Andrea Mantegna in Mantua. He is said to have
learned modelling along with the celebrated Begarelli at
Parma; and it has even been suggested that, in the &ldquo;Pietà&rdquo;
executed by Begarelli for the church of Santa Margherita, the
three finest figures are the work of Correggio, but, as the group
appears to have been completed three years after the painter&rsquo;s
death, there is very little plausibility in this story. Another
statement connecting Begarelli with Correggio is probably true,
namely, that the sculptor executed models in relief for the figures
which the painter had to design on the cupolas of the churches in
Parma. This was necessarily an expensive item, and it has been
cited as showing that Correggio must have been at least tolerably
well off,&mdash;an inference further supported by the fact that he used
the most precious and costly colours, and generally painted on
fine canvases or sometimes on sheets of copper.</p>

<p>The few certain early works of Correggio show a rapid progression
towards the attainment of his own original style.
Though he never achieved any large measure of reputation
during his brief lifetime, and was perhaps totally unknown
beyond his own district of country, he found a sufficiency of
employers, and this from a very youthful age. One of his early
pictures, painted in 1514 when he was nineteen or twenty years
old, is a large altar-piece commissioned for the Franciscan
convent at Carpi, representing the Virgin enthroned, with
Saints; it indicates a predilection for the style of Leonardo da
Vinci, and has certainly even greater freedom than similarly
early works of Raphael. This picture is now in the Dresden
gallery. Another painting of Correggio&rsquo;s youth is the &ldquo;Arrest of
Christ.&rdquo; A third is an Ancona (or triple altar-piece&mdash;the
&ldquo;Repose in Egypt, with Sts Bartholomew and John&rdquo;) in the
church of the Conventuali at Correggio, showing the transition
from the painter&rsquo;s first to his second style. Between 1514 and
1520 Correggio worked much, both in oil and in fresco, for churches
and convents. In 1521 he began his famous fresco of the
&ldquo;Ascension of Christ,&rdquo; on the cupola of the Benedictine church of
San Giovanni in Parma; here the Redeemer is surrounded by
the twelve apostles and the four doctors of the church, supported
by a host of wingless cherub boys amid the clouds. This he
finished in 1524, and soon afterwards undertook his still vaster
work on another cupola, that of the cathedral of the same city,
presenting the &ldquo;Assumption of the Virgin,&rdquo; amid an unnumbered
host of saints and angels rapt in celestial joy. It
occupied him up to 1530. The astounding boldness of scheme in
these works, especially as regards their incessant and audacious
foreshortenings&mdash;the whole mass of figures being portrayed as in
the clouds, and as seen from below&mdash;becomes all the more
startling when we recall to mind the three facts&mdash;that Correggio
had apparently never seen any of the masterpieces of Raphael or
his other great predecessors and contemporaries, in Rome,
Florence, or other chief centres of art; that he was the first
artist who ever undertook the painting of a large cupola; and
that he not only went at once to the extreme of what can be
adventured in foreshortening, but even forestalled in this attempt
the mightiest geniuses of an elder generation&mdash;the &ldquo;Last
Judgment&rdquo; of Michelangelo, for instance, not having been
begun earlier than 1533 (although the ceiling of the Sixtine
chapel, in which foreshortening plays a comparatively small part,
dates from 1508 to 1512). The cupola of the cathedral has
neither skylight nor windows, but only light reflected from below;
the frescoes, some portions of which were ultimately supplied by
Giorgio Gandini, are now dusky with the smoke of tapers, and
parts of them, in the cathedral and in the church of St John,
have during many past years been peeling off. The violent
foreshortenings were not, in the painter&rsquo;s own time, the object of
unmixed admiration; some satirist termed the groups a &ldquo;guazzetto
di rane,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hash of frogs.&rdquo; This was not exactly the
opinion of Titian, who is reported to have said, on seeing the
pictures, and finding them lightly esteemed by local dignitaries,
&ldquo;Reverse the cupola, and fill it with gold, and even that will not
be its money&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo; Annibale Caracci and the Eclectics
generally evinced their zealous admiration quite as ardently.
Parma is the only city which contains frescoes by Correggio.
For the paintings of the cupola of San Giovanni he received the
moderate sum of 472 sequins; for those of the cathedral, much
less proportionately, 350. On these amounts he had to subsist,
himself and his family, and to provide the colours, for about ten
years, having little time for further work meanwhile. Parma was
in an exceedingly unsettled and turbulent condition during some
of the years covered by Correggio&rsquo;s labours there, veering
between the governmental ascendancy of the French and of the
Pope, with wars and rumours of wars, alarms, tumults and
pestilence.</p>

<p>Other leading works by Correggio are the following:&mdash;The
frescoes in the Camera di San Paolo (the abbess&rsquo;s saloon) in the
monastery of S. Lodovico at Parma, painted towards 1519 in
fresco,&mdash;&ldquo;Diana returning from the Chase,&rdquo; with auxiliary
groups of lovely and vivacious boys of more than life size, in
sixteen oval compartments. In the National Gallery, London,
the &ldquo;Ecce Homo,&rdquo; painted probably towards 1520 (authenticity
not unquestioned); and &ldquo;Cupid, Mercury and Venus,&rdquo; the
latter more especially a fine example. The oil-painting of the
Nativity named &ldquo;Night&rdquo; (&ldquo;La Notte&rdquo;), for which 40 ducats
and 208 livres of old Reggio coin were paid, the nocturnal scene
partially lit up by the splendour proceeding from the divine
Infant. This work was undertaken at Reggio in 1522 for Alberto
Pratoneris, and is now in the Dresden gallery. The oil-painting
of St Jerome, termed also &ldquo;Day&rdquo; (&ldquo;Il Giorno&rdquo;), as contrasting
with the above-named &ldquo;Night.&rdquo; Jerome is here with the
Madonna and Child, the Magdalene, and two Angels, of whom
one points out to the Infant a passage in the book held by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
Saint. This was painted for Briseida Bergonzi from 1527 onwards,
and was remunerated by 400 gold imperials, some cartloads
of faggots and measures of wheat, and a fat pig. It is now in
the gallery at Parma. The &ldquo;Magdalene lying at the entrance
of her Cavern&rdquo;: this small picture (only 18 in. wide) was bought
by Augustus III. of Saxony for 6000 louis d&rsquo;or, and is in Dresden.
In the same gallery, the two works designated &ldquo;St George&rdquo;
(painted towards 1532) and &ldquo;St Sebastian.&rdquo; In the Parma
gallery, the Madonna named &ldquo;della Scala,&rdquo; a fresco which was
originally in a recess of the Porta Romana, Parma; also the
Madonna &ldquo;della Scodella&rdquo; (of the bowl, which is held by the
Virgin&mdash;the subject being the Repose in Egypt): it was executed
for the church of San Sepolcro. Both these works date towards
1526. In the church of the Annunciation, &ldquo;Parma,&rdquo; a fresco
of the Annunciation, now all but perished. Five celebrated
pictures painted or begun in 1532,&mdash;&ldquo;Venus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Leda,&rdquo; &ldquo;Danaë,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Vice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Virtue&rdquo;: the &ldquo;Leda,&rdquo; with figures of charming
girls bathing, is now in the Berlin gallery, and is a singularly
delightful specimen of the master. In Vienna, &ldquo;Jupiter and
Io.&rdquo; In the Louvre, &ldquo;Jupiter and Antiope,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mystic
Marriage of St Catharine.&rdquo; In the Naples Museum, the
&ldquo;Madonna Reposing,&rdquo; commonly named &ldquo;La Zingarella,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Madonna del Coniglio&rdquo; (Gipsy-girl, or Madonna of the
Rabbit). On some of his pictures Correggio signed &ldquo;Lieto,&rdquo;
as a synonym of &ldquo;Allegri.&rdquo; About forty works can be confidently
assigned to him, apart from a multitude of others
probably or manifestly spurious.</p>

<p>The famous story that this great but isolated artist was once,
after long expectancy, gratified by seeing a picture of Raphael&rsquo;s,
and closed an intense scrutiny of it by exclaiming &ldquo;Anch&rsquo; io son
pittore&rdquo; (I too am a painter), cannot be traced to any certain
source. It has nevertheless a great internal air of probability;
and the most enthusiastic devotee of the Umbrian will admit
that in technical <i>bravura</i>, in enterprizing, gifted, and consummated
execution, not Raphael himself could have assumed to lord it
over Correggio.</p>

<p>In 1520 Correggio married Girolama Merlino, a young lady
of Mantua, who brought him a good dowry. She was but sixteen
years of age, very lovely, and is said by tradition to have been
the model of his Zingarella. They lived in great harmony
together, and had a family of four children. She died in 1529.
Correggio himself expired at his native place on the 5th of March
1534. His illness was a short one, and has by some authors been
termed pleurisy. Others, following Vasari, allege that it was
brought on by his having had to carry home a sum of money,
50 scudi, which had been paid to him for one of his pictures, and
paid in copper coin to humiliate and annoy him; he carried the
money himself, to save expense, from Parma to Correggio on a
hot day, and his fatigue and exhaustion led to the mortal illness.
In this curious tale there is no symptom of authenticity, unless
its very singularity, and the unlikelihood of its being invented
without any foundation at all, may be allowed to count for
something. He is said to have died with Christian piety; and
his eulogists (speaking apparently from intuition rather than
record) affirm that he was a good citizen, an affectionate son and
father, fond and observant of children, a sincere and obliging
friend, pacific, beneficent, grateful, unassuming, without meanness,
free from envy and tolerant of criticism. He was buried
with some pomp in the Arrivabene chapel, in the cloister of the
Franciscan church at Correggio.</p>

<p>Regarding the art of Correggio from an intellectual or emotional
point of view, his supreme gift may be defined as suavity,&mdash;a
vivid, spontaneous, lambent play of the affections, a heartfelt
inner grace which fashions the forms and features, and beams
like soft and glancing sunshine in the expressions. We see
lovely or lovable souls clothed in bodies or corresponding loveliness,
which are not only physically charming, but are so informed
with the spirit within as to become one with that in movement
and gesture. In these qualities of graceful naturalness, not
heightened into the sacred or severe, and of joyous animation,
in momentary smiles and casual living turns of head or limb,
Correggio undoubtedly carried the art some steps beyond anything
it had previously attained, and he remains to this day the
unsurpassed or unequalled model of pre-eminence. From a
technical point of view, his supreme gift&mdash;even exceeding his
prodigious faculty in foreshortening and the like&mdash;is chiaroscuro,
the power of modifying every tone, from bright light to depth
of darkness, with the sweetest and most subtle gradations, all
being combined into harmonious unity. In this again he far
distanced all predecessors, and defied subsequent competition.
His colour also is luminous and precious, perfectly understood
and blended; it does not rival the superb richness or deep intense
glow of the Venetians, but on its own showing is a perfect achievement,
in exact keeping with his powers in chiaroscuro and in
vital expression. When we come, however, to estimate painters
according to their dramatic faculty, their power of telling a story
or impressing a majestic truth, their range and strength of mind,
we find the merits of Correggio very feeble in comparison with
those of the highest masters, and even of many who without,
being altogether great have excelled in these particular qualities.
Correggio never <i>means</i> much, and often, in subjects where fulness
of significance is demanded, he means provokingly little. He
expressed his own miraculous facility by saying that he always
had his thoughts at the end of his pencil; in truth, they were
often thoughts rather of the pencil and its controlling hand than
of the teeming brain. He has the faults of his excellences&mdash;sweetness
lapsing into mawkishness and affectation, empty in
elevated themes and lasciviously voluptuous in those of a
sensuous type, rapid and forceful action lapsing into posturing
and self-display, fineness and sinuosity of contour lapsing into
exaggeration and mannerism, daring design lapsing into incorrectness.
No great master is more dangerous than Correggio to
his enthusiasts; round him the misdeeds of conventionalists
and the follies of connoisseurs cluster with peculiar virulence,
and almost tend to blind to his real and astonishing excellences
those practitioners or lovers of painting who, while they can
acknowledge the value of <i>technique</i>, are still more devoted to
greatness of soul, and grave or elevated invention, as expressed
in the form of art.</p>

<p>Correggio was the head of the school of painting of Parma,
which forms one main division of the Lombardic school. He
had more imitators than pupils. Of the latter one can name
with certainty only his son Pomponio, who was born in 1521
and died at an advanced age; Francesco Capelli; Giovanni
Giarola; Antonio Bernieri (who, being also a native of the town
of Correggio, has sometimes been confounded with Allegri);
and Bernardo Gatti, who ranks as the best of all. The Parmigiani
(Mazzuoli) were his most highly distinguished imitators.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORRENTI, CESARE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1815-1888), Italian revolutionist and
politician, was born on the 3rd of January 1815, at Milan, of a
poor but noble family. While employed in the public debt
administration, he flooded Lombardy with revolutionary
pamphlets designed to excite hatred against the Austrians, and in
1848 proposed the general abstention of the Milanese from
smoking, which gave rise to the insurrection known as the Five
Days. During the revolt he was one of the leading spirits of the
operations of the insurgents. Until the reoccupation of Milan by
the Austrians he was secretary-general of the provisional government,
but afterwards he fled to Piedmont, whence he again
distributed his revolutionary pamphlets throughout Lombardy,
earning a precarious livelihood by journalism. Elected deputy in
1849, he worked strenuously for the national cause, supporting
Cavour in his Crimean policy, although he belonged to the Left.
After the annexation of Lombardy he was made commissioner for
the liquidation of the Lombardo-Venetian debt, in 1860 was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
appointed councillor of state, and received various other public
positions, especially in connexion with the railway and financial
administration. He veered round to the Right, and in 1867 and
again in 1869 he held the portfolio of education; he played an
important part in the events consequent upon the occupation of
Rome, and helped to draft the Law of Guarantees. As minister
of education he suppressed the theological faculties in the Italian
universities, but eventually resigned office and allied himself
with the Left again on account of conservative opposition to his
reforms. His defection from the Right ultimately assured the
advent of the Left to power in 1876; and while declining office,
he remained chief adviser of Agostino Depretis until the latter&rsquo;s
death. On several occasions&mdash;notably in connexion with the
redemption of the Italian railways, and with the Paris exhibition
of 1878&mdash;he acted as representative of the government. In 1877
he was given the lucrative appointment of secretary of the order
of Saints Maurice and Lazarus by Depretis, and in 1886 was
created senator. He died at Rome on the 4th of October 1888.
He left a considerable body of writings on a variety of subjects,

<p><span class="bold">CORRESPONDENCE<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (from med. scholastic Lat. <i>correspondentia</i>,
<i>correspondere</i>, compounded of Lat.  <i>cum</i>, with, and <i>respondere</i>, to
answer; cf. Fr. <i>correspondence</i>), strictly a mutual agreement or
fitness of parts or character, that which fits or answers to a
requirement in another, or more generally a similarity or parallelism.
In the 17th and 18th centuries the word was frequently
applied to relations and communications between states. It is
now, outside special applications, chiefly applied to the interchange
of communications by letter, or to the letters themselves,
between private individuals, states, business houses, or from
individuals to the press. The &ldquo;doctrine of correspondence or
correspondences,&rdquo; one of the leading tenets of Swedenborgianism,
is that every natural object corresponds to and typifies some
spiritual principle or truth, this being the only key to the true
interpretation of Scripture. In mathematics, the term &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo;
implies the existence of some relation between the
members of two groups of objects. If each object of one group
corresponds to one and only one object of the second, and vice
versa, then a one-to-one correspondence exists between the
groups. If each object of the first group corresponds to &beta; objects
of the second group, and each object of the second group corresponds
to a objects of the first group, then an &alpha; to &beta; correspondence
exists between the two groups. For examples of the
application of this notion see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Curve</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORRÈZE,<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> a department of south-central France, formed
from the southern portion of the old province of Limousin,
bounded N. by the departments of Haute-Vienne and Creuse, E,
by Puy-de-Dôme, S.E. by Cantal, S. by Lot, and W. by Dordogne.
Area, 2273 sq. m. Pop. (1906) 317,430. Corrèze is situated on
the western fringe of the central plateau of France. It forms a
hilly tableland elevated in the east and north, and intersected by
numerous fertile river valleys, trending for the most part to the
south and south-west. The highest points, many of which
exceed 3000 ft., are found in the north, where the Plateau de
Millevaches separates the basins of the Loire and the Garonne.
Except for a small district in the extreme north, which is watered
by the Vienne, Corrèze belongs to the basin of the Garonne. The
Dordogne waters its south-eastern region. The Corrèze, from
which the department takes its name, and the Vézère, of which
the Corrèze is the chief tributary, rise in the Plateau de Millevaches,
flow south-west, and unite to the west of Brive. The
climate of Corrèze is, in general, cold, damp and variable, except
in the south-west, where it is mild and agreeable. The majority
of the inhabitants live by agriculture. About one-third of the
department is arable land, most of which is found in the south-west.
Rye, buckwheat and wheat (in the order named) are the
most abundant cereals. Hemp, flax and tobacco are also grown.
The more elevated regions of the north and east are given over to
pasture, sheep being specially numerous on the Plateau de
Millevaches. Pigs and goats are reared to a considerable extent;
and poultry-farming and cheese-making are much practised.
The vineyards of the neighbourhood of Brive produce wine of
medium quality. Chestnuts, largely used as an article of food,
walnuts and cider-apples are the chief fruits. Coal in small
quantities, slate, building-stone and other stone are the mineral
products, and clay, used in potteries and tile-works, is also
worked. The most important industrial establishment is the
government manufactory of fire-arms at Tulle. There are
flour-mills, breweries, oil-works, saw-mills and dye-works; and
hats (Bort), coarse woollens, silk, preserved foods, wooden shoes,
chairs, paper and leather are manufactured. Coal and raw
materials for textile industries are leading imports; live stock
and agricultural products are the chief exports. The department
is served by the Orléans railway, and the Dordogne is navigable.
The department is divided into the arrondissements of Tulle,
Brive and Ussel, containing 29 cantons and 289 communes. It
belongs to the archdiocese of Bourges, the region of the XII.
army corps, and the <i>Académie</i> (educational division) of Clermont-Ferrand.
Its court of appeal is at Limoges. Tulle, the capital,
and Brive are the principal towns of the department. Uzerche is
a picturesque old town on the Vézère, with a Romanesque church,
old houses, a gate and other remains of medieval fortifications.
At Aubazine (or Obazine) there is a Romanesque church of the
12th century, formerly belonging to the celebrated Cistercian
abbey, of which Étienne &ldquo;of Obazine&rdquo; (d. 1159 and subsequently
beatified) was the founder and first abbot. It contains the fine
sculptured tomb of the founder. To the same style belong the
abbey church of Beaulieu, the south portal of which is elaborately
carved, the abbey church of Meymac, and the abbey church of
Vigeois. Treignac, with its church, bridge and ramparts of the
15th century, and Turenne, dominated by the ruins of the castle
of the famous family of that name, are ancient and interesting
towns. The dolmen at Espartignac and the cromlech of Aubazine
are the chief megalithic remains in the department. A Roman
eagle and other antiquities have been found close to Ussel, which
at the end of the 16th century became the centre of the duchy of
Ventadour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORRIB, LOUGH,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> a lake of western Ireland, in the counties
Galway and Mayo. It lies N.W. and S.E., and is 27 m. long,
including a long projecting arm at the north-west. The extreme
breadth is 7 m., but the outline is extremely irregular, and the
lough narrows near the centre to a few hundred yards. Lough
Corrib is very shallow, hardly exceeding 30 ft. in depth at any
point, and it is covered with islands, of which there are some
300. It lies 29 ft. above sea-level, and drains by the short river
Corrib to Galway Bay. The large Lough Mask lies to its north
and is connected with it by a partly subterranean channel.
The scenery is pleasant, but the shores are low, except at the
north-west, where the wild foothills of Joyce&rsquo;s Country rise.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORRIDOR<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (Fr. <i>corridor</i>, from Ital. <i>corridore</i>, Med. Lat. <i>corridorium</i>,
a &ldquo;running-place,&rdquo; from <i>currere</i>, to run), a main passage
in a large building, on which various apartments open. In public
offices, prisons, workhouses, hospitals, &amp;c., the corridors are
usually of severe simplicity; but in mansions and palaces large
corridors (galleries) are often adorned with works of art, whence
comes the term &ldquo;picture gallery&rdquo; applied to many collections.
The term &ldquo;corridor carriage&rdquo; is applied to the modern style of
railway carriage in which a narrow passage connects the separate
compartments, the object being to combine a certain degree of
privacy for the traveller with access from one compartment to
another whilst the train is in motion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORRIENTES,<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> a north-eastern province of the Argentine
Republic, and part of a region known as the Argentine Mesopotamia,
bounded N. by Paraguay, N.E. by Misiones (territory),
E. by Brazil, S. by Entre Rios, and W. by Santa Fé and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
Chaco. Pop. (1895) 239,618; (1904 estimate) 299,479; area,
32,580 sq. m. Nearly one-third of the province is covered by
swamps and lagoons, or is so little above their level as to be
practically unfit for permanent settlement unless drained. The
Iberá lagoon (c. 8500 sq. m., according to the <i>Argentine Year
Book</i> for 1905-1906) includes a large part of the central
and north-eastern departments, and the Maloya lagoon covers
a large part of the north-western departments. Several streams
flowing into the Paraná and Uruguay have their sources in these
lagoons, the Iberá sending its waters in both directions. The
southern districts of the province, however, are high and rolling,
similar to the neighbouring departments of Entre Rios, and
are admirably adapted to grazing and agriculture. The north-eastern
corner is also high, but it is broken by ranges of hills
and is heavily forested, like the adjacent territory of Misiones.
The climate on the higher plains is sub-tropical, but in the
northern swamps it is essentially tropical. Corrientes is the
hottest province of Argentina, notwithstanding its large area of
water and forest. The exports include cattle and horses, jerked
beef, hides, timber and firewood, cereals and fruit. The principal
towns are Corrientes, the capital; Goya, a flourishing agricultural
town (1906 estimate, 7000) on a side channel of the
Paraná, 150 m. S. of Corrientes, the seat of a modern normal
school and the market-town of a prosperous district; Bella
Vista (pop. 1906 estimate, 3000), prettily situated on the Paraná,
80 m. S. of Corrientes, the commercial centre of a large district;
Esquina (pop. 1906 estimate, 3000) on the Paraná at the mouth
of the Corrientes river, 86 m. S. of Goya, which exports timber
and firewood from the neighbouring forest of Payubre; Monte
Caseros (pop. 1906 estimate, 4000) on the Uruguay river, from
which cattle are shipped to Brazil, the eastern terminus of the
Argentine North-Eastern railway (which crosses the province
in a N.W. direction to Corrientes), and a station on the East
Argentine railway (which runs northward to Paso de Los Libres,
opposite Uruguayana, Brazil and to San Tomé, and southward
to a junction with the Entre Rios railways). A considerable
district on the upper Uruguay was once occupied by prosperous
Jesuit missions, all of which fell into decay and ruins after the
expulsion of that order from the Spanish possessions in 1767.
The population of the province is composed very largely of
Indian and mixed races, and Guarani is still the language of the
country people.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORRIENTES<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (<i>San Juan de Corrientes</i>), a city and river port,
and the capital of the above province, in the north of the
Argentine Republic, on the left bank of the Paraná river, 20 m.
below the junction of the Upper Paraná and Paraguay, and
832 m. N. of Buenos Aires. The name is derived from the <i>siete
corrientes</i> (seven currents) caused by rocks in the bed of the
river just above the town. Pop. (1895) 16,129; (1907 local
estimate) 30,172, largely Indian and of mixed descent. The
appearance of Corrientes is not equal to its commercial and
political importance, the buildings both public and private
being generally poor and antiquated. There are four churches,
the more conspicuous of which are the Matriz and San Francisco.
The government house, originally a Jesuit college, is an antiquated
structure surrounding an open court (<i>patio</i>). There is
a national college. The commercial importance of Corrientes
results from its unusually favourable situation near the confluence
of the Upper Paraná and Paraguay, and a short distance
below the mouth of the Bermejo. The navigation of the Upper
Paraná and Bermejo rivers begins here, and freight for the
Upper Paraná and Chaco rivers is transhipped at Corrientes,
which practically controls the trade of the extensive regions
tributary to them. Corrientes is the western terminus of the
Argentine North-Eastern railway, which crosses the province S.E.
to Monte Caseros, where it connects with the East Argentine
line running S. to Concordia and N. to San Tomé. The principal
exports are timber, cereals, maté, sugar, tobacco, hides, jerked
beef, fruit and quebracho.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORRIGAN, MICHAEL AUGUSTINE<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (1839-1902), third
archbishop of the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New York,
in the United States, was born in Newark, New Jersey, on the
13th of August 1839. In 1859 he graduated at Mount St Mary&rsquo;s
College, Emmittsburg, Maryland, and began his studies for the
priesthood as the first of the twelve students with whom the
American College at Rome was opened. On the 19th of September
1863 he was ordained priest, and in 1864 obtained the degree
of D.D. Returning to America, he was appointed professor of
Dogmatic Theology and Sacred Scripture, and director of the
ecclesiastical seminary of Seton Hall College at South Orange,
New Jersey; soon afterwards he was made vice-president of
the institution; and in 1868 became president, succeeding Rev.
Bernard J. M&lsquo;Quaid (b. 1823), the first Roman Catholic bishop
of Rochester. In October 1868 Corrigan became vicar-general
of Newark, a diocese then including all the state of New Jersey.
When Archbishop Bayley was transferred to the see of Baltimore
in 1873, Pius IX. appointed Corrigan bishop of Newark. In
1876 he resigned the presidency of Seton Hall College. In 1880
Bishop Corrigan was made coadjutor, with the right of succession,
to Cardinal McCloskey, archbishop of New York, under the
title of archbishop of Petra; and thereafter nearly all the practical
work of the archdiocese fell to his hands. He was at the time
the youngest archbishop in the Catholic Church in America.
On the death of Cardinal McCloskey in 1885 Archbishop Corrigan
became metropolitan of the diocese of New York. He died on
the 5th of May 1902. He was a scholar of much erudition, with
great power of administrative organization, simple, generous and
kindly in character. The earlier years of his archiepiscopate
were disturbed by his controversy with Edward McGlynn
(1839-1900), a New York priest (and a fellow-student with
Corrigan at Rome), who disapproved of parochial schools,
refused to go to Rome for examination, and was excommunicated
in July 1887, but returned to the church five years
later.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORRUPT PRACTICES,<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> a term used in English election law, as
defined by the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883,
to include bribery, treating, undue influence, personation, and
aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring personation. Bribery
and corruption at elections have been the subject of much
legislation, statutes for their prevention have been passed in 1729,
1809, 1827, 1842, 1854, 1868 and 1883.</p>

<p>By the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883
(which incorporated the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act 1854,
an act that repealed all former legislation) the following persons
are to be deemed guilty of <i>bribery</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Every person who shall directly or indirectly, by himself
or by any other person on his behalf, give, lend, &amp;c., or offer,
promise, or promise to procure, &amp;c., any money or valuable consideration
to or for any voter or any other person in order to
induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting, or shall corruptly
do any such act on account of such voter having voted or refrained
from voting at any election.</p>

<p>2. Every person who shall similarly give or procure or promise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
&amp;c., any office, place or employment to or for any voter or other
person in order to induce him to vote, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Every person who shall make any gift, loan, promise, &amp;c., as
aforesaid to any person to induce such person to procure the
return of any person to serve in parliament or the vote of any
voter.</p>

<p>4. Every person who shall, in consequence of such gift, procure
or engage, promise or endeavour to procure the return of any
person or the vote of any voter.</p>

<p>5. Every person who shall pay any money with the intent that
it should be spent in bribery, or who shall pay money in repayment
of any money wholly or in part expended in bribery.</p>

<p>6. Every person who before or during an election shall receive
or contract for any money, &amp;c., for voting, or refraining, or
agreeing to vote or to refrain from voting.</p>

<p>7. Every person who, after the election, receives money, &amp;c.,
on account of any person having voted or refrained, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Treating.</i>&mdash;Any person who corruptly by himself or by any
other person either before, during or after an election, directly or
indirectly gives or provides, or pays wholly or in part the expense
of giving or providing any meat, drink or entertainment, or
provision to or for any person in order to be elected, or for being
elected, or for the purpose of corruptly influencing such person to
give or refrain from giving his vote at an election, &amp;c., shall be
deemed guilty of treating, and every elector corruptly accepting
such meat, drink, &amp;c., shall also be guilty of treating.</p>

<p><i>Undue Influence.</i>&mdash;Every person who shall directly or indirectly
make use of or threaten to make use of any force,
violence, &amp;c., or inflict or threaten to inflict any temporal or
spiritual injury, &amp;c., upon any person to induce or compel such
person to vote or refrain from voting, or who shall by abduction,
duress, or any fraudulent device or contrivance impede or
prevent the exercise of the franchise of any elector, or shall
thereby compel, induce, &amp;c., any elector to give or refrain from
giving his vote, shall be guilty of undue influence.</p>

<p>Illegal, as distinguished from &ldquo;corrupt,&rdquo; practices are certain
acts and omissions in regard to an election which are now
prohibited, whether done or omitted, honestly or dishonestly.
They may be classified under the following heads:&mdash;(1) Acts
which are illegal practices by whomsoever committed. These are
as follows: Payment or receipt or contracts to pay or receive
money for conveyance of voters to or from the poll, on account of
any committee room beyond the number allowed by the act, or
to an elector for use of house or land to exhibit addresses, &amp;c., or
for exhibition by him (otherwise than in the ordinary course of
his business of advertising agent) of such addresses, &amp;c.; payment
of election expenses otherwise than by or through the
election agent, and payment otherwise than to a candidate or
election agent of money provided by any other person for election
expenses; voting or procuring to vote of any person prohibited
from voting, if the person offending knows of the prohibition;
knowingly publishing a false statement that a candidate has
withdrawn, or publishing with a view to affect the return of a
candidate a false statement as to his character or conduct. (2)
Acts and omissions which are illegal practices in the case of
candidates and agents only, being breaches of duties specially
imposed on them. These are the payment or incurring expenses
in excess of the maximum authorized by the legislature, the
omitting without lawful excuse to make a return and declaration
of expenses in due time, and the payment by an election agent
of any election expense amounting to 40s. not vouched by bill of
particulars and receipt, of any claim for expenses not sent in in
due time, or of any such claim after the time allowed for payment
thereof. (3) Acts which are illegal practices when done by a
candidate or agent, and are a minor offence when done by any one
else. These are illegal payments, employment and hiring, and
printing, publishing or posting a bill, placard or poster not
bearing on its face the name of the printer or publisher. Illegal
payments are knowingly providing money for prohibited payments
or expenses in excess of the maximum, corruptly inducing
a candidate to withdraw by payment or promise of payment (the
candidate so induced being guilty of the like offence), paying or
agreeing to pay for torches, flags, banners, cockades, ribbons and
other marks of distinction (the receiver being guilty of the like
offence if he is aware of the illegality). Illegal employment is the
employment for payment or promise of payment of persons
beyond the number allowed by the legislature or for purposes not
authorized. The employé is guilty of the like offence if he knows
of the illegality. Illegal hiring is the letting or lending, or the
employing, hiring, borrowing or using to carry voters to the poll
of stage, or hackney carriages, or horses, or of carriages or horses
ordinarily let for hire, and the hiring of committee rooms in
premises licensed for the sale of intoxicants, in a club (not being a
permanent political club) where intoxicants are sold, in premises
where refreshments are ordinarily sold, or in a public elementary
school in receipt of a parliamentary grant. Personation and
aiding, abetting, &amp;c., of personation are felonies punishable with
two years&rsquo; imprisonment with hard labour. All other corrupt
practices are indictable misdemeanours (in Scotland, crimes and
offences) punishable with one year&rsquo;s imprisonment, with or
without hard labour, or a fine not exceeding £200. Conviction of
any corrupt practice also renders the offender incapable for seven
years of being registered as an elector, or voting at any election,
parliamentary or other, in the United Kingdom, or of holding any
public or judicial office, or of being elected to or sitting in the
House of Commons; and any such office or seat held by him at
the time is vacated. In the case of a parliamentary candidate, if
an election court finds that there has been treating or undue
influence by him, or any other corrupt practice with his knowledge
or consent, he becomes incapable of ever being elected for
the same constituency, and incurs the like incapacities as if he
had been convicted on indictment; if it is found by the election
court that he has been guilty by his agents of a corrupt practice,
he becomes incapable for seven years of being elected for the
same constituency. Illegal practices are offences punishable on
summary conviction with a fine not exceeding £100, and with
five years&rsquo; incapacity for being registered or voting as a parliamentary
elector, or an elector to public office within the county
or borough where the offence was committed. Illegal payments,
employment and hiring, and printing and publishing of bills, &amp;c.,
not bearing the printer&rsquo;s or publisher&rsquo;s name, are, when committed
by any one who is not a candidate or agent, offences
punishable on summary conviction with a fine not exceeding
£100, but carry with them no incapacities. Where an election
court finds that any illegal practice has been committed with the
knowledge or consent of a parliamentary candidate, he becomes
incapable for seven years of being elected to or sitting in the
House of Commons for the same constituency. He incurs the
like incapacity, limited to the duration of the parliament for
which the election was held, if the election court finds that he was
guilty by his agents of an illegal practice. A prosecution for any
of the above offences cannot be instituted more than a year after
the offence was committed, unless an inquiry by election commissioners
takes place, in which case it may be instituted at any
time within two years from the commission of the offence, not
being more than three months after the date of the commissioners&rsquo;
report.</p>

<p>The law as to corrupt and illegal practices, as above stated,
applies equally to parliamentary, municipal, county and parish
council elections. Incapacities corresponding to those incurred
by parliamentary candidates found guilty by an election court are
incurred by municipal and other candidates in the like case,
e.g. a municipal candidate found personally guilty of a corrupt
practice is incapacitated forever, and a candidate found guilty by
his agents is incapacitated for three years from holding corporate
office in the borough.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORSICA<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (Fr. <i>Corse</i>), a large island of the Mediterranean,
forming a department of France. It is situated immediately
to the north of Sardinia (from which it is separated by the narrow
strait of Bonifacio), between 41° 21&prime; and 43° N. and 8° 30&prime; and
9° 30&prime; E. Area, 3367 sq.m. Pop. (1906) 291,160. Corsica lies
within 54 m. W. of the coast of Tuscany, 98 m. S. of Genoa and
106 m. S.E. of the French coast at Nice. The extreme length
of the island is 114 m. and its breadth 52 m. The greater part
of the surface of Corsica is occupied by forest-clad mountains,
whose central ridge describes a curve from N.W. to S.W., presenting
its convexity towards the E. Secondary chains diverge
in all directions from this main range, enclosing small basins
both geographically and socially isolated; on the west and south
of the island they either terminate abruptly on the shore or
run out to a great distance into the sea, forming picturesque
bays and gulfs, some of which afford excellent harbours. The
highest peaks are the Monts Cinto (8881 ft.), Rotondo (8612),
Paglia Orba (8284), Padro (7851) and d&rsquo;Oro (7845). On the
eastern side of the island, between Bastia and Porto Vecchio,
there intervenes between the mountains and the sea a considerable
tract of low and unhealthy, but fertile country, and the coast is
fringed in places by lagoons.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;Corsica may be divided into two parts, which are geologically
distinct, by a line drawn from Belgodere through Corte
to the east coast near Favone. West of this line the island is composed
chiefly of granite, with a large mass of granophyres, quartz
porphyries and similar rocks forming the high mountains around
Mt. Cinto; but between the Gulfs of Porto and Galeria, schists,
limestones and anthracite, containing fossils of Upper Carboniferous
age, occur. The famous orbicular diorite of Corsica is found near
Sta. Lucia-di-Tallano in the arrondissement of Sartène. In the
eastern part of the island the predominant rocks are schists of
unknown age, with intrusive masses of serpentine and euphotide.
Folded amongst the schists are Strips of Upper Carboniferous beds
similar to those of the west coast. Overlying these more ancient
rocks are limestones with Rhaetic and Liassic fossils, occurring in
small patches at Oletta, Morosaglia, &amp;c. Nummulitic limestone of
Eocene age is found near St Florent, and occupies several large
basins near the boundary between the granite and the schist. Miocene
molasse with <i>Clypeaster</i>, &amp;c., forms the plain of Aleria on the
east coast, and occurs also at St Florent in the north and Bonifacio
in the south. A small patch of Pliocene has been found near Aleria.
The caves of Corsica, especially in the neighbourhood of Bastia,
contain numerous mammalian remains, the commonest of which
belong to <i>Lagomys corsicanus</i>, Cuv.</p>

</div>

<p>Corsica is well watered by rivers and torrents, which, though
short in their course, bring down large volumes of water from
the mountains. The longest is the Golo, which rises in the
pastoral region of Niolo, isolated among the mountains to the
west of Corte and inhabited by a distinct population of obscure
origin. It enters the sea on the east coast to the south of
the salt-water lake of Biguglia; farther south, on the same
side of the island, is the Tavignano, while on the west there
are the Liamone, the Gravone and the Taravo. The other
streams are all comparatively small. Owing to the rugged and
indented outline of the western coast there are an unusual number
of bays and harbours. Of the bays the most important are
Porto, Sagone, Ajaccio and Valinco; of the ports, St Florent
(San Fiorenzo), Ile Rousse (Isola Rossa), Calvi, Ajaccio and
Propriano. On the eastern side, which is much less rugged and
broken, the only harbours worth mentioning are those of Bastia
and Porto Vecchio (the <i>Portus Syracusanus</i> of the ancients),
and the only gulfs those of Porto Vecchio and Santa Manza.
At the extreme south are the harbour and town of Bonifacio,
giving name to the strait which separates Corsica from Sardinia.</p>

<p>The climate of the island ranges from warmth in the lowlands
to extreme rigour in the mountains. The intermediate
region is the most temperate and healthy. The mean annual
temperature at Ajaccio is 63° F. The dominant winds are those
from the south-west and south-east.</p>

<p>There are mines of anthracite, antimony and copper; the
island produces granite, building stone, marble, and amianthus,
and there are salt marshes. Among other places Guagno,
Pardina Guitera, and Orezza have mineral springs.</p>

<p>The agriculture of Corsica suffers from scarcity of labour, due
partly to the apathy of the inhabitants, and from scarcity of
capital. The cultivation of cereals, despite the fertility of the
soil, is neglected; wheat is grown to some extent, but in this
respect, the population is dependent to a large degree on outside
supplies. The culture of fruit, especially of the vine, cedrates,
citrons and olives (for which the Balagne region, in the north-west,
is noted), of vegetables and of tobacco, and sheep and goat
rearing are the main rural industries, to which may be added
the rearing of silk-worms. The exploitation of the fine forests,
which contain the well-known Corsican pine, beeches, oaks and
chestnuts, is also an important resource, but tends to proceed
too rapidly. Chestnuts are exported, and, ground into flour,
are used as food by the mountaineers. Most of the inhabitants
are proprietors of land, but often the properties are so split
up that many hours, or even a whole day, are spent in going
from the vineyard or olive plantation to the arable land in the
plain or the chestnut-wood in the mountain. A great part of the
agricultural labour is performed by labourers from Tuscany
and Lucca, who periodically visit the island for that purpose.
Sheep of a peculiar breed, resembling chamois and known as
<i>mouflons</i>, inhabit the more inaccessible parts of the mountains.
The uncultivated districts are generally overgrown with a thick
tangled underwood, consisting of arbutus, myrtle, thorn, laurel
broom and other fragrant shrubs, and known as the <i>maquis</i>, the
fragrance of which can be distinguished even from the sea.</p>

<p>Fishing and shooting are allowed almost everywhere to the
possessor of a government licence; special permission, where
it is necessary, is easily obtained. Wild boars, stags, in the
eastern districts, and hares as well as the <i>mouflon</i> are found,
while partridges, quail, woodcock, wild duck and water-fowl
are abundant. Trout and eels are the chief fish. The flesh of
the Corsican blackbird is considered a delicacy. The fisheries
of tunny, pilchard and anchovy are extensively prosecuted for
the supply of the Italian markets; but comparatively few of
the natives are engaged in this industry.</p>

<p>The Corsican is simple and sober but unenterprising; dignified
and proud, he is possessed of a native courtesy, manifested in
his hospitality to strangers, the refusal of which is much resented.
He is, however, implacable towards his own countrymen when
his enmity is once aroused, and the practice of the blood-feud
or <i>vendetta</i> has not died out. Each individual is attached to
some powerful family, and the influence of this usage is specially
marked in politics, the individual voting with his clan on pain
of arousing the vindictiveness of his fellow-members. Another
dominant factor in social life in Corsica is the almost universal
ambition on the part of the natives towards an official career,
a tendency from which commerce and agriculture inevitably
suffer.</p>

<p>The manufactures of the island are of small importance.
They include the extraction of gallic acid from chestnut-bark,
the preparation of preserved citrons and other delicacies, and
of macaroni and similar foods and the manufacture of fancy
goods and cigars.</p>

<p>The chief ports are Bastia, Ajaccio and Ile Rousse. A railway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
runs from Bastia to Ajaccio with branches to Calvi and Ghisonaccia,
but, in general, lack of means of communication as well
as of capital are a barrier to commercial activity. In 1905
imports reached a value of £113,000. The chief were tobacco
furniture and wooden goods, wine, cereals, coal, cheese and bran.
Exports were valued at £336,000, and included chestnut-extract,
charcoal, timber, citrons and other fruits, seeds, casks, skins,
chestnuts and tanning bark.</p>

<p>Corsica is divided into five arrondissements (chief towns&mdash;Ajaccio,
Bastia, Calvi, Corte and Sartène), with 62 cantons
and 364 communes. It forms part of the <i>académie</i> (educational
circumscription) and archiepiscopal province of Aix (Bouches-du-Rhône)
and of the region of the XV. army corps. The principal
towns are Ajaccio, the capital and the seat of the bishop of the
island and of the prefect; Bastia, the seat of the court of appeal and
of the military commander; Calvi, Corte and Bonifacio. Other
places of interest are St Florent, near which stand the ruins of
the cathedral (12th century) of the vanished town of Nebbio;
Murato, which has a church (12th or 13th century) of Pisan
architecture, which is exemplified in other Corsican churches; and
Cargese, where there is a Greek colony, dating from the 17th
century. Near Lucciana are the ruins of a fine Romanesque church
called La Canonica. Megalithic monuments are numerous, chief
among them being the dolmen of Fontanaccia in the arrondissement
of Sartène.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The earliest inhabitants of Corsica were probably
Ligurian. The Phocaeans of Ionia were the first civilized people
to establish settlements there. About 560 B.C. they landed in the
island and founded the town of Alalia. By the end of the 6th
century, however, their power had dwindled before that of the
Etruscans, who were in their turn driven out by the Carthaginians.
The latter were followed by the Romans, who gained a footing in
the island at the time of the First Punic War, but did not establish
themselves there till the middle of the 2nd century B.C. Both
Marius and Sulla founded colonies&mdash;the one at Mariana (near
Lucciana) in 104, the second at Aleria in 88. In the early
centuries of the Christian era Corsica formed one of the senatorial
provinces of the Empire, but though it was in continuous
commercial communication with Italy, it was better known as a
place of banishment for political offenders. One of the most
distinguished of those was the younger Seneca, who spent in
exile there the eight years ending A.D. 49.</p>

<p>During the break-up of the Roman empire in the West the
possession of Corsica was for a while disputed between the
Vandals and the Gothic allies of the Roman emperors, until in
469 Genseric finally made himself master of the island. For
65 years the Vandals maintained their domination, the Corsican
forests supplying the wood for the fleets with which they terrorized
the Mediterranean. After the destruction of the Vandal
power in Africa by Belisarius, his lieutenant Cyril conquered
Corsica (534) which now, under the exarchate of Africa, became
part of the East Roman empire. The succeeding period was
one of great misery. Goths and Lombards in turn ravaged the
island, which in spite of the prayers of Pope Gregory the Great
the exarch of Africa did nothing to defend; the rule of the
Byzantines was effective only in grinding excessive taxes out of
the wretched population; and, to crown all, in 713 the Mussulmans
from the northern coast of Africa made their first descent
upon the island. Corsica remained nominally attached to the
East Roman empire until Charlemagne, having overthrown the
Lombard power in Italy (774), proceeded to the conquest of the
island, which now passed into the hands of the Franks. In 806,
however, occurred the first of a series of Moorish incursions from
Spain. Several times defeated by the emperor&rsquo;s lieutenants, the
Moors continually returned, and in 810 gained temporary
possession of the island. They were crushed and exterminated
by an expedition under the emperor&rsquo;s son Charles, but none the
less returned again and again. In 828 the defence of Corsica was
entrusted to Boniface II., count of the Tuscan march, who
conducted a successful expedition against the African Mussulmans,
and returning to Corsica built a fortress in the south of the
island which formed the nucleus of the town (Bonifacio) that
bears his name. Boniface&rsquo;s war against the Saracens was
continued by his son Adalbert, after he had been restored to his
father&rsquo;s dignities in 846; but, in spite of all efforts, the Mussulmans
seem to have remained in possession of part of the island
until about 930. Corsica, of which Berengar II., king of Italy,
had made himself master, became in 962, after his dethronement
by Otto the Great, a place of refuge for his son Adalbert, who
succeeded in holding the island and in passing it on to his son,
another Adalbert. This latter was, however, defeated by the
forces of Otto II., and Corsica was once more attached to the
marquisate of Tuscany, of which Adalbert was allowed to hold
part of the island in fee.</p>

<p>The period of feudal anarchy now began, a general mellay
of petty lords each eager to expand his domain. The counts
of Cinarca, especially, said to be descended from
Adalbert, aimed at establishing their supremacy over
<span class="sidenote">The Terra di Comune.</span>
the whole island. To counteract this and similar
ambitions, in the 11th century, a sort of national diet
was held, and Sambucuccio, lord of Alando, put himself at the
head of a movement which resulted in confining the feudal lords
to less than half of the island to the south, and in establishing in
the rest, henceforth known as the Terra di Comune, a sort of
republic composed of autonomous parishes. This system, which
survived till the Revolution, is thus described by Jacobi (tom. i.
p. 137), &ldquo;Each parish or commune nominated a certain number
of councillors who, under the name of &lsquo;fathers of the commune,&rsquo;
were charged with the administration of justice under the
direction of a <i>podestà</i>, who was as it were their president. The
podestas of each of the states or enfranchised districts chose a
member of the supreme council charged with the making of
laws and regulations for the Terra di Comune. This council or
magistracy was called the Twelve, from the number of districts
taking a share in its nomination. Finally, in each district the
fathers of the commune elected a magistrate who, under the
name of <i>caporale</i>, was entrusted with the defence of the interests
of the poor and weak, with seeing that justice was done to them,
and that they were not made the victims of the powerful and
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the south remained under the sway of the counts of
Cinarca, while in the north feudal barons maintained their
independence in the promontory of Cape Corso. Internal
feuds continued; William, marquis of Massa, of
<span class="sidenote">Papal sovereignty</span>
the family known later as the Malaspina, was called in
by the communes (1020), drove out the count of
Cinarca, reduced the barons to order, and in harmony with the
communes established a dominion which he was able to hand on
to his son. Towards the end of the 11th century, however, the
popes laid claim to the island in virtue of the donation of Charlemagne,
though the Frankish conqueror had promised at most the
reversion of the lands of the Church. The Corsican clergy supported
the claim, and in 1077 the Corsicans declared themselves
subjects of the Holy See in the presence of the apostolic legate
Landolfo, bishop of Pisa. Pope Gregory VII. thereupon invested
the bishop and his successors with the island, an investiture
confirmed by Urban II. in 1190 and extended into a concession of
the full sovereignty. The Pisans now took solemn possession of
the island and their &ldquo;grand judges&rdquo; (<i>judices</i>) took the place of
<span class="sidenote">Rule of Pisa.</span>
the papal legates. Corsica, valued by the Pisans as by
the Vandals as an inexhaustible storehouse of materials
for their fleet, flourished exceedingly under the enlightened
rule of the great commercial republic. Causes of
dissension remained, however, abundant. The Corsican bishops
repented their subjection to the Pisan archbishop; the Genoese
intrigued at Rome to obtain a reversal of the papal gift to the
rivals with whom they were disputing the supremacy of the seas.
Successive popes followed conflicting policies in this respect;
until in 1138 Innocent II., by way of compromise, divided the
ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the island between the archbishops
of Pisa and Genoa. This gave the Genoese great influence in
Corsica, and the contest between the Pisans and Genoese began to
distract the island. It was not, however, till 1195 that the
Genoese, by capturing Bonifacio&mdash;a nest of pirates preying on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
commerce of both republics&mdash;actually gained a footing in the
country. For twenty years the Pisans fought to recover the
fortress for themselves, until in 1217 the pope settled the matter
by taking it into his own hands.</p>

<p>Throughout the 13th century the struggle between Pisans
and Genoese continued, reproducing in the island the feud of
Ghibellines and Guelphs that was desolating Italy. In order
to put a stop to the ruinous anarchy the chiefs of the Terra di
Comune called in the marquis Isnard Malaspina; the Pisans
set up the count of Cinarca once more; and the war between
the marquis, the Pisans and Genoese dragged on with varying
fortunes, neither succeeding in gaining the mastery. Then, in
1298, Pope Boniface VIII. added to the complication by investing
King James of Aragon with the sovereignty of Corsica and of
Sardinia. In 1325, after long delay, the Aragonese attacked
and reduced Sardinia, with the result that the Pisans, their
sea-power shattered, were unable to hold their own in Corsica.
A fresh period of anarchy followed until, in 1347, a great assembly
of <i>caporali</i> and barons decided to offer the sovereignty of the
island to Genoa. A regular tribute was to be paid to the republic;
the Corsicans were to preserve their laws and customs,
under the council of Twelve in the north and a council of Six
in the south; Corsican interests were to be represented at
Genoa by an <i>orator</i>.</p>

<p>The Genoese domination, which began under evil auspices&mdash;for
the Black Death killed off some two-thirds of the population&mdash;was
not destined to bring peace to the island. The
feudal barons of the south and the hereditary <i>caporali</i>
<span class="sidenote">Genoese domination.</span>
of the north alike resisted the authority of the Genoese
governors; and King Peter of Aragon took advantage
of their feuds to reassert his claims. In 1372 Arrigo, count of
La Rocca, with the assistance of Aragonese troops, made himself
master of the island; but his very success stirred up against
him the barons of Cape Corso, who once more appealed to Genoa.
The republic, busied with other affairs, hit upon the luckless
expedient of investing with the governorship of the island a sort
of chartered company, consisting of five persons, known as the
<i>Maona</i>. They attempted to restore order by taking Arrigo
della Rocca into partnership, with disastrous results. In 1380
four of the &ldquo;governors of the Maona&rdquo; resigned their rights to
the Genoese republic, and Leonello Lomellino was left as sole
governor. It was he who, in 1383, built Bastia on the north
coast, which became the bulwark of the Genoese power in the
island. It was not till 1401, after the death of Count Arrigo,
that the Genoese domination was temporarily re-established.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Genoa itself had fallen into the hands of the French,
and in 1407 Leonello Lomellino returned as governor with the
title of count of Corsica bestowed on him by Charles VI. of France.
But Vincentello d&rsquo; Istria, who had gained distinction in the
service of the king of Aragon, had captured Cinarca, rallied round
him all the communes of the Terra di Comune, proclaimed himself
count of Corsica at Biguglia and even seized Bastia. Lomellino
was unable to make headway against him, and by 1410 all
Corsica, with the exception of Bonifacio and Calvi, was lost to
Genoa, now once more independent of France. A feud of
Vincentello with the bishop of Mariana, however, led to the
loss of his authority in the Terra di Comune; he was compelled
to go to Spain in search of assistance, and in his absence the
Genoese reconquered the island. Not, however, for long. The
Great Schism was too obvious an opportunity for quarrelling
for the Corsicans to neglect; and the Corsican bishops and clergy
were more ready with the carnal than with spiritual weapons.
The suffragans of Genoa fought for Benedict XIII., those of
Pisa for John XXIII.; and when Vincentello returned with an
Aragonese force he was able to fish profitably in troubled waters.
He easily captured Cinarca and Ajaccio, came to terms with the
Pisan bishops, mastered the Terra di Comune and built a strong
castle at Corte; by 1419 the Genoese possessions in Corsica
were again reduced to Calvi and Bonifacio.</p>

<p>At this juncture Alphonso of Aragon arrived, with a large
fleet, to take possession of the island. Calvi fell to him; but
Bonifacio held out, and its resistance gave time for the
Corsicans, aroused by the tyranny and exactions of the
<span class="sidenote">Aragonese intervention.</span>
Aragonese, to organize revolt. In the end the siege of
Bonifacio was raised, and the town, confirmed in its
privileges, became practically an independent republic
under Genoese protection. As for Vincentello he
managed to hold his own for a while; but ultimately
the country rose against him, and in 1435 he was executed as a
rebel by the Genoese, who had captured him by surprise in the
port of Bastia.</p>

<p>The anarchy continued, while rival factions, nominal adherents
of the Aragonese and Genoese, contended for the mastery.
Profiting by the disturbed situation, the Genoese doge, Janus
da Fregoso, succeeded in reducing the island, his artillery securing
him an easy victory over the forces of Count Paolo della
Rocca (1441). To secure his authority he built and fortified
the new city of San Fiorenzo, near the ruins of Nebbio. But again
the Aragonese intervened, and the anarchy reached its height.
An appeal to Pope Eugenius IV. resulted in the despatch of a
pontifical army of 14,000 men (1444), which was destroyed
in detail by a league of some of the <i>caporali</i> and most of the barons
under the bold leadership of Rinuccio da Leca. A second
expedition was more fortunate, and Rinuccio was killed before
Biguglia. In 1447 Eugenius was succeeded on the papal throne
by Nicholas V., a Genoese, who promptly made over his rights
in Corsica, with all the strong places held by his troops, to Genoa.
The island was now, in effect, divided between the Genoese
republic; the lords of Cinarca, who held their lands in the south
under the nominal suzerainty of Aragon; and Galeazzo da
Campo Fregoso, who was supreme in the Terra di Comune.</p>

<p>An assembly of the chiefs of the Terra di Comune now decided
to offer the government of the island to the Company or Bank
of San Giorgio, a powerful commercial corporation
established at Genoa in the 14th century.<a name="FnAnchor_1m" id="FnAnchor_1m" href="#Footnote_1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The bank
<span class="sidenote">The Bank of San Giorgio.</span>
accepted; the Spaniards were driven from the country;
and a government was organized. But the bank
soon fell foul of the barons, and began a war of extermination
against them. Their resistance was finally broken in 1460,
when the survivors took refuge in Tuscany. But order had
scarcely been established when the Genoese Tommasinoda Campo
Fregoso, whose mother was a Corsican, revived the claims of
his family and succeeded in mastering the interior of the island
(1462). Two years later the duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza,
overthrew the power of the Fregoso family at Genoa, and promptly
proceeded to lay claim to Corsica. His lieutenant had no
difficulty in making the island accept the overlordship of the
duke of Milan; but when, in 1466, Francesco Sforza died, a
quarrel broke out, and Milanese suzerainty became purely
<span class="sidenote">Milanese intervention.</span>
nominal save in the coast towns. Finally, in 1484,
Tommasino da Campo Fregoso persuaded the duke to
grant him the government of the island. The strong
places were handed over to him; he entered into
marriage relations with Gian Paolo da Leca, the most powerful
of the barons, and was soon supreme in the island.</p>

<p>Within three years the Corsicans were up in arms again. A
descendant of the Malaspinas who had once ruled in Corsica,
Jacopo IV. (d&rsquo;Appiano), was now prince of Piombino, and to him
the malcontents applied. His brother Gherardo, count of
Montagnano, accepted the call, proclaimed himself count of
Corsica, and, landing in the island, captured Biguglia and San
Fiorenzo; whereupon Tommasino da Campo Fregoso discreetly
sold his rights to the bank of San Giorgio. No sooner, however,
had the bank&mdash;with the assistance of the count of Leca&mdash;beaten
Count Gherardo than the Fregoso family tried to repudiate their
bargain. Their claims were supported by the count of Leca, and
it cost the agents of the bank some hard fighting before the
turbulent baron was beaten and exiled to Sardinia. Twice he
returned, and he was not finally expelled from the country till
1501; it was not till 1511 that the other barons were crushed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
that the bank could consider itself in secure possession of the
island.</p>

<p>If the character of the Corsicans has been distinguished in
modern times for a certain wild intractableness and ferocity, the
cause lies in their unhappy past, and not least in the character
of the rule established by the bank of San Giorgio. The power
which the bank had won by ruthless cruelty, it exercised in the
spirit of the narrowest and most short-sighted selfishness. Only
a shadow of the native institutions was suffered to survive, and
no adequate system of administration was set up in the place of
that which had been suppressed. In the absence of justice the
blood-feud or <i>vendetta</i> grew and took root in Corsica just at the
time when, elsewhere in Europe, the progress of civilization was
making an end of private war. The agents of the bank, so far
from discouraging these internecine quarrels, looked on them as
the surest means for preventing a general rising. Concerned,
moreover, only with squeezing taxes out of a recalcitrant
population, they neglected the defence of the coast, along
which the Barbary pirates harried and looted at will; and to
all these woes were added, in the 16th century, pestilences and
disastrous floods, which tended still further to impoverish and
barbarize the country.</p>

<p>In these circumstances King Henry II. of France conceived the
project of conquering the island. From Corsican mercenaries in
French service, men embittered by wrongs suffered at
the hands of the Genoese, he obtained all the necessary
<span class="sidenote">First French Intervention, 1553.</span>
information; by a treaty of alliance concluded at Constantinople
(February 1, 1553) with Sultan Suleiman
the Magnificent he secured the co-operation of the Turkish
fleet. The combined forces attacked the island the same
year; the citadel of Bastia fell almost without a blow, and siege
was at once laid simultaneously to all the other fortresses. The
capitulation of Bonifacio to the Turks, after an obstinate resistance,
was followed by the treacherous massacre of the garrison;
soon, of all the strong places, the Genoese held Calvi alone. At
this juncture the emperor Charles V. intervened; a strong force
of imperial troops and Genoese was poured into the island, and
the tide of war turned. The details of the struggle that followed,
in which the Corsican national hero Sampiero da Bastelica gained
his first laurels, are of little general importance. Fortresses were
captured and recaptured; and for three years French, Germans,
Spaniards, Genoese and Corsicans indulged in a carnival of
mutual slaughter and outrage. The outcome of all this was a
futile reversion to the <i>status quo</i>. In 1556, indeed, the conclusion
of a truce left Corsica&mdash;with the exception of Bastia&mdash;in the
hands of the French, who proceeded to set up a tolerable government;
but in 1559, by the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, the
island was restored to the bank of San Giorgio, from which it
was at once taken over by the Genoese republic.</p>

<p>Trouble at once began again. The Genoese attempted to levy
a tax which the Corsicans refused to pay; in violation of the
terms of the treaty, which had stipulated for a universal
amnesty, they confiscated the property of
<span class="sidenote">Sampiero da Bastelica.</span>
Sampiero da Bastelica. Hereupon Sampiero again put
himself at the head of the national movement. The
suzerainty of the Turk seemed preferable to that of Genoa, and,
armed with letters from the king of France, he went to Constantinople
to ask the aid of a fleet for the purpose of reducing Corsica
to the status of an Ottoman province.<a name="FnAnchor_2m" id="FnAnchor_2m" href="#Footnote_2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> All his efforts to secure
foreign help were, however, vain; he determined to act alone,
and in June 1564 landed at Valinco with only fifty followers.
His success was at first extraordinary, and he was soon at the
head of 8000 men; but ultimate victory was rendered impossible
by the indiscipline among the Corsicans and by the internecine
feuds of which the Genoese well knew how to take advantage.
For over two years a war was waged in which quarter was given
on neither side; but after the assassination of Sampiero in 1567
the spirit of the insurgents was broken. In 1568 an honourable
peace, including a general amnesty, was arranged with the
Genoese commander Giorgio Doria by Sampiero&rsquo;s son Alphonso
d&rsquo;Ornano, who with 300 of his friends emigrated to France,
where he rose to be a marshal under Henry IV.</p>

<p>From this time until 1729 Corsica remained at peace under
the government of Genoa. It was, however, a peace due to
lassitude and despair rather than contentment. The settlement
of 1568 had reserved a large measure of autonomy to the
Corsicans; during the years that followed this was withdrawn
piecemeal, until, disarmed and powerless, they were excluded
from every office in the administration. Nor did the Genoese
substitute any efficient system for that which they had destroyed.
In the absence of an effective judiciary the <i>vendetta</i> increased; in
the absence of effective protection the sea-board was exposed to
the ravages of the Barbary pirates, so that the coast villages and
towns were abandoned and the inhabitants withdrew into the
interior, leaving the most fertile part of the country to fall into
the condition of a malarious waste. To add to all this, in 1576
the population had been decimated by a pestilence. Emigration
<i>en masse</i> continued, and an attempt to remedy this by introducing
a colony of Greeks in 1688 only added one more element of
discord to the luckless island. To the Genoese Corsica continued
to be merely an area to be exploited for their profit; they
monopolized its trade; they taxed it up to and beyond its
capacity; they made the issue of licences to carry firearms a
source of revenue, and studiously avoided interfering with the
custom of the <i>vendetta</i> which made their fiscal expedient so
profitable.<a name="FnAnchor_3m" id="FnAnchor_3m" href="#Footnote_3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>In 1729 the Corsicans, irritated by a new hearth-tax known as
the <i>due seini</i>, rose in revolt, their leaders being Andrea Colonna
Ceccaldi and Luigi Giafferi. As usual, the Genoese
were soon confined to a few coast towns; but the
<span class="sidenote">Revolt of 1729.</span>
intervention of the emperor Charles VI. and the
despatch of a large force of German mercenaries turned the
tide of war, and in 1732 the authority of Genoa was re-established.
Two years later, however, Giacinto Paoli once more
raised the standard of revolt; and in 1735 an assembly at Corte
proclaimed the independence of Corsica, set up a constitution, and
entrusted the supreme leadership to Giafferi, Paoli and Ceccaldi.
Though the Genoese were again driven into the fortresses, lack of
arms and provisions made any decisive success of the insurgents
impossible, and when, on the 12th of March 1736, the German
adventurer Baron Theodor von Neuhof arrived with a shipload of
<span class="sidenote">King Theodore of Corsica.</span>
muskets and stores and the assurance of further help
to come, leaders and people were glad to accept his aid
on his own conditions, namely that he should be
acknowledged as king of Corsica. On the 15th of
April, at Alesani, an assembly of clergy and of representatives
of the communes, solemnly proclaimed Corsica an independent
kingdom under the sovereignty of Theodore &ldquo;I.&rdquo; and his heirs.
The new king&rsquo;s reign was not fated to last long. The <i>opéra
bouffe</i> nature of his entry on the stage&mdash;he was clad in a scarlet
caftan, Turkish trousers and a Spanish hat and feather, and girt
with a scimitar&mdash;did not, indeed, offend the unsophisticated
islanders; they were even ready to take seriously his lavish
bestowal of titles and his knightly order &ldquo;della Liberazione&rdquo;;
they appreciated his personal bravery; and the fact that the
Genoese government denounced him as an impostor and set a
price on his head could only confirm him in their affection. But
it was otherwise when the European help that he had promised
failed to arrive, and, still worse, the governments with which he
had boasted his influence disclaimed him. In November he
thought it expedient to proceed to the continent, ostensibly in
search of aid, leaving Giafferi, Paoli and Luca d&rsquo;Ornano as
regents. In spite of several attempts, he never succeeded in
returning to the island. The Corsicans, weary of the war,
opened negotiations with the Genoese; but the refusal of the
latter to regard the islanders as other than rebels made a mutual
agreement impossible. Finally the republic decided to seek the
aid of France, and in July 1737 a treaty was signed by which the
French king bound himself to reduce the Corsicans to order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span></p>

<p>The object of the French in assisting the Genoese was not the
acquisition of the island for themselves so much as to obviate
the danger, of which they had long been aware, of its
falling into the hands of another power, notably Great
<span class="sidenote">Intervention of France, 1738.</span>
Britain. The Corsicans, on the other hand, though
ready enough to come to terms with the French king,
refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of Genoa even when
backed by the power of France. A powerful French force, under
the comte de Boissieux, arrived in the spring of 1738, and for
some months negotiations proceeded. But the effect of the French
guarantee of Corsican liberties was nullified by the demand that
the islanders should surrender their arms, and the attempt of
Boissieux to enforce the order for disarmament was followed, in
the winter of 1738-39, by his defeat at the hands of the Corsicans
and by the cutting up of several isolated French detachments.
In February 1739 Boissieux died. His successor, the
marquis de Maillebois, arrived in March with strong reinforcements,
and by a combination of severity and conciliation soon
reduced the island to order. Its maintenance, however, depended
on the presence of the French troops, and in October 1740 the
death of the emperor Charles VI. and the outbreak of the War of
the Austrian Succession necessitated their withdrawal. Genoese
and Corsicans were once more left face to face, and the perennial
struggle began anew.</p>

<p>In 1743 &ldquo;King Theodore,&rdquo; supported by a British squadron,
made a descent on the island, but finding that he no longer
possessed a following, departed never to return. The
Corsicans, assembled in diet at Casinca, now elected
<span class="sidenote">Sardinian and British Intervention, 1746.</span>
Giampietro Gaffori and Alerio Matra as generals and
&ldquo;protectors of the fatherland&rdquo; (<i>protettori della patria</i>),
and began a vigorous onslaught on the Genoese strongholds.
They were helped now by the sympathy and active aid
of European powers, and in 1746 Count Domenico Rivarola, a
Corsican in Sardinian service, succeeded in capturing Bastia and
San Fiorenzo with the aid of a British squadron and Sardinian
troops. The factious spirit of the Corsicans themselves was,
however, their worst enemy. The British commander judged it
inexpedient to intervene in the affairs of a country of which the
leaders were at loggerheads; Rivarola, left to himself, was unable
to hold Bastia&mdash;a place of Genoese sympathies&mdash;and in spite of
the collapse of Genoa itself, now in Austrian hands, the Genoese
governor succeeded in maintaining himself in the island. By the
time of the signature of the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, the
situation of the island had again changed. Rivarola and Matra
had departed, and Gaffori was left nominally supreme over a
people torn by intestine feuds. Genoa, too, had expelled the
Austrians with French aid, and, owing to a report that the king
of Sardinia was meditating a fresh attempt to conquer the island,
a strong French expedition under the marquis de Cursay had,
at the request of the republic, occupied Calvi, Bonifacio, Ajaccio
and Bastia. By the terms of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
<span class="sidenote">Renewed French Intervention.</span>
Corsica was once more assigned to Genoa, but the
French garrison remained, pending a settlement
between the republic and the islanders. In view of the
intractable temper of the two parties no agreement
could be reached; but Cursay&rsquo;s personal popularity served to
preserve the peace for a while. His withdrawal in 1752, however,
was the signal for a general rising, and once more, at a diet held
at Orezza, Gaffori was elected general and protector. In October
of the following year, however, he fell victim to a <i>vendetta</i> and the
nation was once more leaderless. His place was taken for a while
by Clemente Paoli, son of Giacinto, who for a year or two succeeded,
with the aid of other lieutenants of Gaffori, in holding the
Genoese at bay. He was, however, by temperament unfitted to
lead a turbulent and undisciplined people in time of stress, and in
1755, at his suggestion, his brother Pasquale was invited to come
from Naples and assume the command.</p>

<p>The first task of Pasquale Paoli, elected general in April at an
assembly at San Antonio della Casabianca, was to suppress the
rival faction led by Emanuele Matra, son of Gaffori&rsquo;s former
colleague. By the spring of 1756 this was done, and the Corsicans
were able to turn a united front against the Genoese. At
this juncture the French, alarmed by a supposed understanding
between Paoli and the British, once more intervened, and occupied
<span class="sidenote">Pasquale Paoli.</span>
Calvi, Ajaccio and San Fiorenzo until 1757, when their
forces were once more called away by the wars on the
continent. In 1758 Paoli renewed the attack on the
Genoese, founding the new port of Isola Rossa as a centre whence
the Corsican ships could attack the trading vessels of Genoa. The
republic, indeed, was now too weak to attempt seriously to reassert
its sway over the island, which, with the exception of the
coast towns, Paoli ruled with absolute authority and with conspicuous
wisdom. In the intervals of fighting he was occupied
in reducing Corsican anarchy into some sort of civilized order.
The vendetta was put down, partly by religious influence, partly
with a stern hand; the surviving oppressive rights of the feudal
<i>signori</i> were abolished; and the traditional institutions of the
Terra di Comune were made the basis of a democratic constitution
for the whole island.</p>

<p>As regarded the relations of Corsica all now depended on the
attitude of France to which both Paoli and the republic made
overtures. In 1764 a French expedition under the
comte de Marbeuf arrived, and, by agreement with
<span class="sidenote">Corsica sold to France.</span>
Genoa, garrisoned three of the Genoese fortresses.
Though Genoese sovereignty had been expressly
recognized in the agreement authorizing this, it was in effect
non-existent. French and Corsicans remained on amicable terms,
and the inhabitants of the nominally Genoese towns actually
sent representatives to the national <i>consulta</i> or parliament. The
climax came early in 1767 when the Corsicans captured the
Genoese island of Capraja, and occupied Ajaccio and other places,
evacuated by the French as a protest against the asylum given to
the Jesuits exiled from France. Genoa now recognized that she
had been worsted in the long contest, and on the 15th of May 1768
signed a treaty selling the sovereignty of the island to France.</p>

<p>The Corsicans, intent on independence, were now faced with a
more formidable enemy than the decrepit republic of Genoa.
A section of the people indeed, were in favour of submission;
but Paoli himself declared for resistance; and among those who
supported him at the <i>consulta</i> summoned to discuss the question
was his secretary Carlo Buonaparte, father of Napoleon Bonaparte,
the future emperor of the French. Into the details of the
war that followed, it is impossible to enter here; in the absence
of the hoped-for help from Great Britain its issue could not be
doubtful; and, though the task of the French was a hard one,
by the summer of 1769 they were masters of the island. On the
<span class="sidenote">French conquest.</span>
16th of June Pasquale and Clemente Paoli, with some
400 of their followers, embarked on a British ship for
Leghorn. On the 15th of September 1770, a general
assembly of the Corsicans was summoned and the deputies
swore allegiance to King Louis XV.</p>

<p>For twenty years Corsica, while preserving many of its old
institutions, remained a dependency of the French crown.
Then came the Revolution, and the island, conformed
to the new model, was incorporated in France as a
<span class="sidenote">Corsica and the revolution of 1789.</span>
separate department (see Renucci, ii. p. 271 seq.).
Paoli, recalled from exile by the National Assembly
on the motion of Mirabeau, after a visit to Paris, where
he was acclaimed as &ldquo;the hero and martyr of liberty&rdquo; by the
National Assembly and the Jacobin Club, returned in 1790 to
Corsica, where he was received with immense enthusiasm and
acclaimed as &ldquo;father of the country.&rdquo; With the new order
in the island, however, he was little in sympathy. In the towns
branches of the Jacobin Club had been established, and these
tended, as elsewhere, to usurp the functions of the regular organs
of government and to introduce a new element of discord into
a country which it had been Paoli&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s work to unify.
Suspicions of his loyalty to revolutionary principles had already
been spread at Paris by Bartolomeo Arena, a Corsican deputy
and ardent Jacobin, so early as 1791; yet in 1792, after the fall
of the monarchy, the French government, in its anxiety to secure
Corsica, was rash enough to appoint him lieutenant-general of
the forces and governor (<i>capo comandante</i>) of the island. Paoli
accepted an office which he had refused two years before at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
hands of Louis XVI. With the men and methods of the Terror,
however, he was wholly out of sympathy. Suspected of throwing
obstacles in the way of the expedition despatched in 1793 against
Sardinia, he was summoned, with the procurator-general Pozzo
di Borgo, to the bar of the Convention. Paoli now openly defied
the Convention by summoning the representatives of the communes
<span class="sidenote">Revolt under Paoli.</span>
to meet in diet at Corte on the 27th of May.
To the remonstrances of Saliceti, who attended the
meeting, he replied that he was rebelling, not
against France, but against the dominant faction of
whose actions the majority of Frenchmen disapproved. Saliceti
thereupon hurried to Paris, and on his motion Paoli and his
sympathizers were declared by the Convention <i>hors la loi</i> (June 26).</p>

<p>Paoli had already made up his mind to raise the standard
of revolt against France. But though the <i>consulta</i> at Corte
elected him president, Corsican opinion was by no
means united. Napoleon Bonaparte, whom Paoli had
<span class="sidenote">British occupation, 1794-1796.</span>
expected to win over to his views, indignantly rejected
the idea of a breach with France, and the Bonapartes
were henceforth ranked with his enemies. Paoli now appealed
for assistance to the British government, which despatched a
considerable force. By the summer of 1794, after hard fighting,
the island was reduced, and in June the Corsican assembly
formally offered the sovereignty to King George III. The
British occupation lasted two years, the island being administered
by Sir Gilbert Elliot. Paoli, whose presence was considered
inexpedient, was invited to return to England, where he remained
till his death. In 1796 Bonaparte, after his victorious Italian
campaign, sent an expedition against Corsica. The British,
weary of a somewhat thankless task, made no great resistance,
and in October the island was once more in French hands. It
was again occupied by Great Britain for a short time in 1814,
but in the settlement of 1815 was restored to the French crown.
Its history henceforth is part of that of France.</p>

on the 6th of November 1828, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
He held a position in the library of the Smithsonian Institution,
Washington D.C. (1849-1856), was a lecturer on English literature
in Philadelphia (1859-1865), and was professor of English at
Girard College, Philadelphia (1865-1866), and in St John&rsquo;s College,
Annapolis, Maryland (1866-1870). In 1870-1871 he was
professor of rhetoric and oratory at Cornell University, where he
was professor of Anglo-Saxon and English literature (1872-1886),
of English literature and rhetoric (1886-1890), and from 1890
to 1903 (when he became professor emeritus) of English literature,
a chair formed for him. He edited Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Legende of Goode
Women</i> (1863) and <i>Selections from Chaucer&rsquo;s Canterbury Tales</i>
(1896), and wrote a <i>Hand-Book of Anglo-Saxon and Early English</i>
(1871), and, among other text-books, <i>An Elocutionary Manual</i>
(1864), <i>A Primer of English Verse</i> (1892), and <i>Introductions</i> to
the study of Browning (1886, 1889), of Shakespeare (1889) and
of Milton (1899). The volume on Shakespeare and the <i>Jottings
on the Text of Macbeth</i> (1874) contain some excellent Shakespearian
criticism. He also published <i>The University of the
Future</i> (1875), <i>The Aims of Literary Study</i> (1895), and <i>The
Voice and Spiritual Education</i> (1896). He translated the

<p><span class="bold">CORSSEN, WILHELM PAUL<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> (1820-1875), German philologist,
was born at Bremen on the 20th of January 1820, and received
his school education in the Prussian town of Schwedt, to which
his father, a merchant, had removed. After spending some
time at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin, where his
interest in philological pursuits was awakened by the rector,
Meinike, he proceeded to the university, and there came especially
under the influence of Böckh and Lachmann. His first
important appearance in literature was as the author of <i>Origines
poesis romanae</i>, by which he had obtained the prize offered by
the &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; or &ldquo;arts&rdquo; faculty of the university. In
1846 he was called from Stettin, where he had for nearly two
years held a post in the gymnasium, to occupy the position of
lecturer in the royal academy at Pforta (commonly called
Schulpforta), and there he continued to labour for the next
twenty years. In 1854 he won a prize offered by the Royal
Prussian Academy of Sciences for the best work on the pronunciation
and accent of Latin, a treatise which at once took rank, on
its publication under the title of <i>Über Aussprache, Vocalismus,
und Betonung der lateinischen Sprache</i> (1858-1859), as one of
the most erudite and masterly works in its department. This
was followed in 1863 by his <i>Kritische Beiträge zur lat. Formenlehre</i>,
which were supplemented in 1866 by <i>Kritische Nachträge
zur lat. Formenlehre</i>. In the discussion of the pronunciation of
Latin he was naturally led to consider the various old Italian
dialects, and the results of his investigations appeared in miscellaneous
communications to Kuhn&rsquo;s <i>Zeitschrift für vergleichende
Schriftforschung</i>. Ill-health obliged him to give up his professorship
at Pforta, and return to Berlin, in 1866; but it produced
almost no diminution of his literary activity. In 1867 he published
an elaborate archaeological study entitled the <i>Alterthümer
und Kunstdenkmale des Cistercienserklosters St Marien und der
Landesschule Pforta</i>, in which he gathers together all that can be
discovered about the history of the Pforta academy, the German
&ldquo;Eton,&rdquo; and in 1868-1869 he brought out a new edition of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
work on Latin pronunciation. From a very early period he had
been attracted to the special study of Etruscan remains, and had
at various times given occasional expression to his opinions on
individual points; but it was not till 1870 that he had the
opportunity of visiting Italy and completing his equipment for a
formal treatment of the whole subject by personal inspection of
the monuments. In 1874 appeared the first volume of <i>Über die
Sprache der Etrusker</i>, in which with great ingenuity and erudition
he endeavoured to prove that the Etruscan language was cognate
with that of the Romans. Before the second volume (published
posthumously under the editorship of Kuhn) had received the
last touches of his hand, he was cut off in 1875 by a comparatively
early death.</p>

Cockx of Antwerp. About 1565 he went to Venice, where Titian
employed him to execute the well-known copperplates of St
Jerome in the Desert, the Magdalen, Prometheus, Diana and
Actaeon, and Diana and Calisto. From Italy he wandered back
to the Netherlands, but he returned to Venice soon after 1567,
proceeding thence to Bologna and Rome, where he produced
engravings from all the great masters of the time. At Rome he
founded the well-known school in which, as Bartsch tells us, the
simple line of Marcantonio was modified by a brilliant touch of
the burin, afterwards imitated and perfected by Agostino
Caracci in Italy and Nicolas de Bruyn in the Netherlands.
Before visiting Italy, Cort had been content to copy Michael
Coxcie, F. Floris, Heemskerk, G. Mostaert, Bartholomäus
Spranger and Stradan. In Italy he gave circulation to the
works of Raphael, Titian, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Baroccio,
Giulio Clovio, Muziano and the Zuccari. His connexion with
Cockx and Titian is pleasantly illustrated in a letter addressed to
the latter by Dominick Lampson of Liége in 1567. Cort is said
to have engraved upwards of one hundred and fifty-one plates.
In Italy he was known as Cornelio Fiammingo.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORTE,<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> a town of central Corsica, 52 m. N.E. of Ajaccio by the
railway between that town and Bastia. Pop. (1906) 4839. The
upper town is situated on a precipitous rock overhanging the
confluence of the Tavignano and Restonica, the rest of the town
lying below it on both banks of the rivers. On the summit of the
rock stands a citadel built by Vincentello d&rsquo;Istria (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Corsica</a></span>).
Other interesting buildings are the house in which Pasquale
Paoli lived while Corte was the seat of his government (1755
to 1769), and the house of another patriot, Giampietro Gaffori,
whose wife defended it from the Genoese in 1750. There are
statues of Paoli, of General Gaffori, and of General Arrighi di
Casanova, duke of Padua (d. 1853). Corte is capital of an
arrondissement of the island, has a subprefecture, a tribunal
of first instance and a communal college, and manufactures
alimentary paste. There are marble quarries in the vicinity, and
the town has trade in wine and timber. In the 18th century
Corte was the centre of the resistance to the Genoese, and it
was the seat of a university erected by Paoli.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORTE-REAL, JERONYMO<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (1533-1588), Portuguese epic
poet, came of a noble Portuguese stock. Of the same family
were Gaspar Corte-Real, who in 1500 and 1501 sailed to
Labrador and the Arctic seas; and his brothers Miguel and
Vasco. Their voyages opened the way for important Portuguese
fisheries on the Newfoundland coast (see Henry Harrisse, <i>Les
Corte-Real et leurs voyages au Nouveau-Monde</i>, and <i>Gasper
Corte-Real: la date exacte de sa dernière expédition au Nouveau-Monde</i>,
Paris, 1883). In his youth Jeronymo fought in Africa and
Asia according to the custom of noblemen in that age. There is a
tradition that he was present at the affair of Tangier on the 18th
of May 1553, when D. Pedro de Menezes met his death. Returning
home, it is supposed about 1570, he spent the rest of his days
in retirement. In 1578 he placed his sword at the disposal of
King Sebastian for the fatal expedition to Africa, but the
monarch dispensed him from the journey (it is said) on account of
his age, and in 1586 we find him acting as <i>provedor</i> of the <i>Misericordia</i>
of Evora. He married D. Luiza da Silva, but left no
legitimate issue. Corte-Real was painter as well as soldier and
poet, and one of his pictures is still preserved in the church of
S. Antão at Evora. His poetical works are believed to have been
composed in his old age at the mansion on his estate near Evora,
known as &ldquo;Valle de Palma.&rdquo; <i>O Segundo cerco de Diu</i>, an epic in
21 cantos, deals with the historic siege of that Indian island-fortress
of the Portuguese. First printed in 1574, it had a second
edition in 1783, while a Spanish version appeared at Alcalá in
1597. <i>Austriada</i>, an epic in 15 cantos celebrating the victory of
Don John of Austria over the Turks at Lepanto, was written in
Spanish and published in 1578. King Philip II. accepted the
dedication in flattering terms and visited the poet when he
came to Portugal. <i>Naufragio de Sepulveda</i>, an epic in 17 cantos,
describes the tragic shipwreck on the South African coast and
the death of D. Manoel de Sepulveda with his beautiful wife and
young children, a disaster which drew some feeling stanzas from
Camoens (<i>Lusiads</i>, v. 46). The poem was published four years
after the death of Corte-Real by his heirs, and had two later
editions, while a Spanish version appeared in Madrid in 1624 and
a French in Paris in 1844. <i>Auto dos quatro novissimos do homem</i>
is a short poem printed in 1768. Except the <i>Naufragio de
Sepulveda</i>, which is highly considered in Portugal, Corte-Real&rsquo;s
poetry has hardly stood the test of time, and critics of later
generations have refused to ratify the estimate formed by
contemporaries, who considered him the equal, if not the superior,
of Camoens. His lengthy epics suffer from a want of sustained
inspiration, and are marred by an abuse of epithet, though they
contain episodes of considerable merit, vigorous and well-coloured
descriptive passages, and exhibit a pure diction.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORTES, HERNAN<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> or <span class="bold">HERNANDO</span> (1485-1547), Spanish
soldier, the conqueror of Mexico, was born at Medellin, a small
town of Estremadura, in 1485. He belonged to a noble family of
decayed fortune, and, being destined for the law, was sent, at
fourteen years of age, to the university of Salamanca; but study
was distasteful to him, and he returned home in 1501, resolved
to enter upon a life of adventure. He arranged to accompany
Ovando, who had been appointed to the command of San Domingo,
but was prevented from joining the expedition by an accident
that happened to him in a love adventure. He next sought
military service under the celebrated Gonsalvo de Córdoba, but
a serious illness frustrated his purpose. At last, in 1504, he set
out, according to his first plan, for San Domingo, where he was
kindly received by Ovando. He was then only nineteen, and
remarkable for a graceful physiognomy and amiable manners,
as well as for skill and address in all military exercises. He
remained in San Domingo, where Ovando had successively conferred
upon him several lucrative and honourable employments,
until 1511, when he accompanied Diego Velazquez in his expedition
to the island of Cuba. Here he became alcalde of
Santiago, and displayed great ability on several trying occasions.</p>

<p>An opportunity was soon afforded him of showing his powers
as a military leader. Juan Grijalva, lieutenant of Velazquez,
had just discovered Mexico, but had not attempted to effect a
settlement. This displeased the governor of Cuba, who superseded
Grijalva, and entrusted the conquest of the newly discovered
country to Cortes. The latter hastened his preparations, and, on
the 18th of November 1518, he set out from Santiago, with 10
vessels, 600 or 700 Spaniards, 18 horsemen and some pieces of
cannon. Scarcely had he set sail, however, when Velazquez recalled
the commission which he had granted to Cortes, and even
ordered him to be put under arrest; but the attachment of the
troops, by whom he was greatly beloved, enabled him to persevere
in spite of the governor; and on the 4th of March 1519 he landed
on the coast of Mexico. Advancing along the gulf, sometimes
taking measures to conciliate the natives, and sometimes spreading
terror by his arms, he took possession of the town of Tobasco.
The noise of the artillery, the appearance of the floating fortresses
which had transported the Spaniards over the ocean,
and the horses on which they fought, all new objects to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
natives, inspired them with astonishment mingled with terror
and admiration; they regarded the Spaniards as gods, and sent
them ambassadors with presents. Cortes here learned that the
native sovereign was called Montezuma; that he reigned over
an extensive empire, which had lasted for three centuries; that
thirty vassals, called caciques, obeyed him; and that his riches
were immense and his power absolute. No more was necessary
to inflame the ambition of the invader, who did not hesitate to
undertake the conquest of this great empire, which could only be
effected by combining stratagem and address with force and
courage. He laid the foundation of the town of Vera Cruz,
caused himself to be elected captain-general of the new colony, and
burned his vessels to cut off the possibility of retreat and show
his soldiers that they must either conquer or perish. He then
penetrated into the interior of the country, drew to his camp
several caciques hostile to Montezuma, and induced these native
princes to facilitate his progress. The republic of Tlaxcala,
which was hostile to Montezuma, opposed him; but he routed
its army, which had resisted all the forces of the Mexican empire,
dictated peace on moderate terms and converted the people
into powerful auxiliaries. His farther advance was in vain
attempted to be checked by an ambuscade laid by the inhabitants
of Cholula, on whom he took signal vengeance.</p>

<p>Surmounting all other obstacles he arrived, with 6000 natives
and a handful of Spaniards, in sight of the immense lake on which
was built the city of Mexico, the capital of the empire. Montezuma
received him with great pomp, and his subjects, believing
Cortes to be a descendant of the sun, prostrated themselves
before him. The first care of Cortes was to fortify himself in one
of the beautiful palaces of the prince, and he was planning how
to possess himself of the riches of so opulent an empire, when
intelligence reached him that a general of the emperor, who had
received secret orders, had just attacked the garrison of Vera
Cruz and killed several of his soldiers. The head of one of the
Spaniards was sent to the capital. This event undeceived the
Mexicans, who had hitherto believed the Spaniards to be immortal,
and necessarily altered the whole policy of Cortes. Struck with
the greatness of the danger, surrounded by enemies, and having
only a handful of soldiers, he conceived and instantly executed a
most daring project. Having repaired with his officers to the
palace of the emperor, he announced to Montezuma that he must
either accompany him or perish. Being thus master of the person
of the monarch, he next demanded that the Mexican general
and his officers who had attacked the Spaniards should be delivered
into his hands; and when this had been done he caused
these unfortunate men, who had only obeyed the orders of their
sovereign, to be burned alive before the gates of the imperial
palace. During this cruel execution Cortes entered the apartment
of Montezuma, and caused him to be loaded with irons, in order
to force him to acknowledge himself a vassal of Charles V. The
unhappy prince yielded, and was restored to a semblance of liberty
on presenting the fierce conqueror with 600,000 marks of pure
gold, and a prodigious quantity of precious stones. Scarcely had
he reaped the fruits of his audacity, however, when he was informed
of the landing of a Spanish army, under Narvaez, which
had been sent by Velazquez to compel him to renounce his
command. In this emergency Cortes acted with his usual
decision and courage. Leaving 200 men at Mexico, under the
orders of his lieutenant (Alvarado), he marched against Narvaez,
whom he defeated and made prisoner, and he then enlisted under
his standard the Spanish soldiers who had been sent to attack
him. On his return to the capital, however, he found that the
Mexicans had revolted against the emperor and the Spaniards,
and that dangers thickened around him. Montezuma perished
in attempting to address his revolted subjects; the latter, having
chosen a new emperor, attacked the headquarters of Cortes
with the utmost fury, and, in spite of the advantage of firearms,
forced the Spaniards to retire, as the only means of escaping
destruction. Their rear-guard, however, was cut in pieces, and
they suffered severely during the retreat, which was continued
during six days. Elated with their success, the Mexicans offered
battle in the plain of Otumba. This was what Cortes desired, and
it proved their destruction. Cortes gave the signal for battle,
and, on the 7th of July 1520, gained a victory which decided
the fate of Mexico. Immediately afterwards he proceeded to
Tlaxcala, assembled an auxiliary army of natives, subjected
the neighbouring provinces, and then marched a second time
against Mexico, which, after a gallant defence of several
months, was retaken on the 13th of August 1521.</p>

<p>These successes were entirely owing to the genius, valour and
profound but unscrupulous policy of Cortes; and the account of
them which he transmitted to Spain excited the admiration of his
countrymen. The extent of his conquests, and the ability he
had displayed, effaced the censure which he had incurred by the
irregularity of his operations; and public opinion having declared
in his favour, Charles V., disregarding the pretensions of Velazquez,
appointed him governor and captain-general of Mexico, at
the same time conferring on him the valley of Oaxaca, which was
erected (1529) into a marquisate, with a considerable revenue.
But although his power was thus confirmed by royal authority,
and although he exerted <span class="correction" title="amended from himelf">himself</span> to consolidate Spanish domination
throughout all Mexico, the means he employed were such that
the natives, reduced to despair, took arms against the Spaniards.
This revolt, however, was speedily subdued, and the Mexicans
were everywhere forced to yield to the ascendancy of European
discipline and valour. Guatemotzin, who had been recognized
as emperor, and a great number of caciques, accused of having
conspired against the conquerors, were publicly executed, with
circumstances of great cruelty, by order of Cortes. Meanwhile
the court of Madrid, dreading the ambition and popularity of
the victorious chief, sent commissioners to watch his conduct
and thwart his proceedings; and whilst he was completing the
conquest of New Spain his goods were seized by the fiscal of
the Council of the Indies, and his retainers imprisoned and put
into irons. Indignant at the ingratitude of his sovereign, Cortes
returned in person to Spain to appeal to the justice of the emperor,
and appeared there with great splendour. The emperor received
him with every mark of distinction, and decorated him with the
order of St Iago. Cortes returned to Mexico with new titles
but diminished authority, a viceroy having been entrusted with
the administration of civil affairs, whilst the military department,
with permission to push his conquests, was all that remained to
Cortes. This division of powers became a source of continual
dissension, and caused the failure of the last enterprises in which
he engaged. Nevertheless, in 1536, he discovered the peninsula
of Lower California, and surveyed a part of the gulf which
separates it from Mexico.</p>

<p>At length, tired of struggling with adversaries unworthy of
him, whom the court took care to multiply, he returned to Europe,
hoping to confound his enemies. But Charles V. received him
coldly. Cortes dissembled, redoubled the assiduity of his attendance
on the emperor, accompanied him in the disastrous expedition
to Algiers in 1541, served as a volunteer, and had a horse
killed under him. This was his last appearance in the field, and
if his advice had been followed the Spanish arms would have been
saved from disgrace, and Europe delivered nearly three centuries
earlier from the scourge of organized piracy. Soon afterwards
he fell into neglect, and could scarcely obtain an audience. The
story goes that, having forced his way through the crowd which
surrounded the emperor&rsquo;s carriage, and mounted on the door-step,
Charles, astonished at an act of such audacity, demanded
to know who he was. &ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; replied the conqueror of
Mexico proudly, &ldquo;who has given you more provinces than your
ancestors left you cities.&rdquo; So haughty a declaration of important
services ill-requited could scarcely fail to offend a monarch
on whom fortune had lavished her choicest favours. Cortes,
overwhelmed with disgust, withdrew from court, passed the
remainder of his days in solitude, and died, near Seville, on the
2nd of December 1547.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The only writings of Cortes are five letters on the subject of his
conquests, which he addressed to Charles V. The best edition of
them is that of Don Francisco Antonio Lorenzana, archbishop of
Mexico, entitled <i>Historia de Nueva-España escrita par su esclarecido
conquistador, Hernan Cortes, aumentada con otros documientos y notas</i>
(Mexico, 1770, 4to), a work the noble simplicity of which attests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
the truth of the recital it contains. An English translation of the
letters, edited by Francis A. MacNutt, was published in 1908. The
conquests of Cortes have been described with pompous elegance by
Antonio de Solis in his <i>Historia de la conquista de Mejico</i> (1684), and
with more truth and simplicity by Bernardo Diaz del Castillo in his
work under the same title (1632). See also Sir Arthur Helps&rsquo;s <i>Life

<p><span class="bold">CORTONA,<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> a town and episcopal see of Italy, in the province
of Arezzo, 18 m. S. by E. from the town of Arezzo by rail. The
ancient and modern names are identical. Pop. (1901) of town,
3579; commune, 29,296. The highest point of Cortona, a
medieval castle (Fortezza), is situated 2130 ft. above sea-level
on a hill commanding a splendid view, and is approached by a
winding road. It is surrounded by its ancient Etruscan walls,
which for the greater part of the circuit are fairly well preserved.
They are constructed of parallelepipedal blocks of limestone,
finely jointed (though the jointing has often been spoilt by
weathering), and arranged in regular courses which vary in
size in different parts of the enceinte. Near the N.W. angle
some of the blocks are 7 to 8½ ft. long and 2½ ft. high, while on
the W. side they are a good deal smaller&mdash;sometimes only 1 ft.
high (see F. Noack in <i>Römische Mitteilungen</i>, 1897, 184). Within
the town are two subterranean vaulted buildings in good masonry,
of uncertain nature, some other remains under modern buildings,
and a concrete ruin known as the &ldquo;Bagni di Bacco.&rdquo; The
museum of the Accademia Etrusca, a learned body founded by
Ridolfino Venuti in 1726, is situated in the Palazzo Pretorio;
it contains some Etruscan objects, among which may be specially
noted a magnificent bronze lamp with 16 lights, of remarkably
fine workmanship, found in 1740, at the foot of the hill, two
votive hands and a few other bronzes, and a little gold jewellery.
The library has a good MS. of Dante. The cathedral, originally
a Tuscan Romanesque building of the 11th-12th centuries, is
now a fine Renaissance basilica restored in the 18th century,
containing some paintings by Luca Signorelli, a native of the
place. Opposite is the baptistery, with three fine pictures by
Fra Angelico. S. Margherita, just below the Fortezza, is an
ugly modern building occupying the site of a Gothic church of
1294, and containing a fine original rose window and reliefs
from the tomb of the saint by Angelo e Francesco di maestro
Pietro d&rsquo;Assisi. Other works by Signorelli are to be seen elsewhere
in the town, especially in S. Domenico; Pietro Berettini
(Pietro da Cortona, 1596-1669) is hardly represented here at all.
Below the town is the massive tomb chamber (originally subterranean,
but now lacking the mound of the earth which covered
it) known as the Grotta di Pitagora (grotto of Pythagoras). To
the E. is the church of S. Maria del Calcinaio, a fine early Renaissance
building by Francesco di Giorgio Martini of Siena,
with fine stained glass windows.</p>

<p>The foundation of Cortona belongs to the legendary period
of Italy. It appears in history as one of the strongholds of the
Etruscan power; but in Roman times it is hardly mentioned.
Dionysius&rsquo;s statement that it was a colony (i. 26) is probably
due to confusion.</p>

remarkable for its hardness, and forming in its finer varieties
a valuable gem-stone. Specimens were sent from India to
England in the 18th century, and were described in 1798 by the
Hon. C. Greville under the name of corundum&mdash;a word which
he believed to be the native name of the stone (Hindi, <i>kurund</i>;
Tamil, <i>kurundam</i>; Sanskrit, <i>kuruvinda</i>, &ldquo;ruby&rdquo;). The finely
coloured, transparent varieties include such gem-stones as the
ruby and sapphire, whilst the impure granular and massive forms
are known as emery. The term corundum is often restricted to
the remaining kinds, i.e. those crystallized and crystalline
varieties which are not sufficiently transparent and brilliant
for ornamental purposes, and which were known to the older
mineralogists as &ldquo;imperfect corundum.&rdquo; Such varieties were
termed by J. Black, in consequence
of their hardness,
adamantine spar, but this
name is now usually restricted
to a hair-brown
corundum, remarkable for a
pearly sheen on the basal
plane.</p>

<p>Corundum crystallizes in
the hexagonal system. In
fig. 1, which is a form of
ruby, the prism a is combined
with a hexagonal pyramid
n, a rhombohedron R,
and the basal pinacoid C. In
fig. 2, which represents a typical crystal of sapphire, the prism
s is associated with the acute pyramids b, r, and a rhombohedron
a. Other crystals show a tabular habit, consisting usually of
the basal pinacoid with a rhombohedron, and it is notable that
this habit is said to be characteristic of corundum which has
consolidated from a fused magma. Corundum has no true

the crystal, which have been studied by Prof. J. W. Judd.</p>

<p>Next to diamond, corundum is the hardest known mineral.
Its hardness is generally given as 9, but there are slight variations
in different stones, sapphire being rather harder than ruby, and
ruby than common corundum. The colours are very varied,
and it is probable that iron is responsible for many of the
tints, though chromium is a possible agent in certain cases. The
transparent varieties are often distinguished as &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo;
stones. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ruby</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sapphire</a></span>.) Corundum is used largely
for watch-jewels, and for bearings in electrical apparatus.</p>

<p>The coloured corundums fit for gem-stones come chiefly from
Ceylon, Burma, Siam and Montana. Coarse dull corundum is
found in many localities, and usually has higher commercial
value as an abrasive agent than emery, which is less pure. The
coarse corundum, however, is often partially hydrated or otherwise
altered, whereby its hardness is diminished. In India,
where the native lapidaries use corundum-sticks and rubbers
formed of the powdered mineral cemented with lac, it occurs
in the Salem district, Madras, in Mysore and in Rewa. Large
deposits of corundum exist in the United States, especially in N.
Carolina and Georgia, where they are associated with peridotites,
often near contact with gneiss. The mineral has been extensively
worked, as at Corundum Hill, Macon county, N.C., near which,
in 1871, were discovered numerous rubies, sapphires and pebbles
of coarse corundum in the bed of a river. Corundum occurs also
at many localities in Montana, where the crystals are often of gem
quality. They are found mostly as loose crystals in gravel, but
are known also in igenous rocks like andesite and lamprophyre.
Prof. J. H. Pratt, who has studied the occurrence both in Montana
and in N. Carolina, considers that the alumina was dissolved in
a molten magma, from which it separated at an early period of
consolidation, as illustrated by the experiments of J. Morozewicz.
Corundum occurs also in Canada in an igneous rock, a
nepheline-syenite, associated with Laurentian gneiss. Important
deposits were discovered by the Geological Survey in 1896, in
Hastings county, Ontario; and corundum is now worked there
and in Renfrew county. New South Wales, Queensland and
Victoria are other localities for corundum. The mineral is found
also in the Urals and the Ilmen Mountains, in the Alps (in
dolomite), in the basalts of the Rhine, and indeed as a subordinate
rock-constituent corundum seems to enjoy a wide distribution,
being found even in the British Isles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORUNNA,<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> a maritime province in the extreme north-west of
Spain; forming part of Galicia, and bounded on the E. by Lugo,
S. by Pontevedra, W. and N. by the Atlantic Ocean. Pop. (1900)
653,556; area, 3051 sq. m. The coast of Corunna is exposed to
the full force of the Atlantic; it forms one succession of fantastically
shaped promontories, divided by bays and estuaries which
often extend for many miles inland, with reefs and small islands
in their midst. Though well lighted, this coast is very dangerous
to navigation, gales and fogs being frequent in winter and spring.
The most conspicuous headlands are Cape Ortegal and Cape de
Vares, the most northerly points of the Spanish seaboard, and
Capes Finisterre and Toriñana in the extreme west. The
principal bays are those of Santa Marta, Ferrol and Corunna,
on the north; Corcubion, Muros y Noya and Arosa, on the west.
Wild and rugged though this region appears to travellers at sea,
the mountains which overspread the interior are covered with
forests and pastures, and watered by an abundance of small
rivers and streams. The climate is mild and singularly equable,
but the rainfall is very heavy. All the fruits and vegetables
of northern Europe thrive in the sheltered valleys, and the
cultivation of cherries, strawberries, peas and onions, for export,
ranks among the most profitable local industries. Heavy crops
of wheat, rye, maize and sugar-beet are raised. The wines of
Corunna are heady and of inferior flavour. Cattle-breeding,
once a flourishing industry, had greatly declined by the beginning
of the 20th century, owing to foreign competition. All along
the coast there are valuable fisheries of sardines, lobsters, cod,
hake and other fish. Copper, tin and gold are procured in small
quantities, and other minerals undoubtedly exist. The exports
consist chiefly of farm produce and fish; the imports, of coal and
textiles from England, petroleum from the United States, marble
from Italy, salt fish from Norway and Newfoundland, and hides.
The principal towns are Corunna, the capital and chief port (pop.
1900, 43,971); Ferrol (25,281), another seaport; Santiago de
Compostela (24,120), famous as a place of pilgrimage; Carballo
(13,032); Ortigueira (18,426) and Ribeira (12,218). These are
described under separate headings. Along the coast there are
numerous trading and fishing stations of minor importance.
Railway communication is very defective. From Corunna a line
passes south-eastward to Lugo and Madrid, and from Santiago
another line goes southward to Vigo and Oporto; but the centre
and the north-west of the province are, to a great extent, inaccessible
except by road; and many, even of the main highways,
are ill-constructed and ill-kept. Very few Spanish provinces
have so high a birthrate, but the population increases very
slowly owing to emigration. For a description of the peasantry,
who are distinguished in may respects from those inhabiting
other parts of Spain, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Galicia</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORUNNA<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (Span. <i>La Coruña</i>; Fr. <i>La Corogne</i>; Eng. formerly
often <i>The Groyne</i>), the capital of the province described above;
in 43° 22&prime; N., and 8° 22&prime; W.; on the bay of Corunna, an inlet of the
Atlantic Ocean. Pop. (1900) 43,971. The principal railways of
north-western Spain converge on Corunna, and afford direct
communication with Madrid and Oporto. Corunna consists of
an upper and a lower town, built respectively on the eastern side
of a small peninsula, and on the isthmus connecting the peninsula
with the mainland. The upper town is the more ancient, and is
still surrounded by walls and bastions, and defended by a citadel;
but it has been gradually outgrown by the lower, which, though
at first a mere fishing village, as its name of <i>Pescaderia</i> implies,
is now comparatively well built, and has many broad and handsome
streets. There is little remarkable in the public buildings,
although the churches of Santiago and the Colegiata date respectively
from the 12th and 13th centuries, and there are several
convents, two hospitals, a palace for the captain-general of
Galicia, a theatre, a school of navigation, an arsenal and barracks.
The harbour is on the east. Though difficult to approach in
stormy weather, it is completely sheltered, and accommodates
vessels drawing 22 ft. It is defended by several forts, of which
the most important are San Diego, on the east, and San Antonio,
on the west. These fortifications are of little practical value on
the landward side, as they are commanded by a hill which overlooks
the town. The so-called Tower of Hercules, on the north,
has been increased by modern additions to a height of nearly
400 ft., and is surmounted by a fine revolving light. Many
foreign steamers call here, for emigrants or mails, on their way
to South America. Upwards of 1200 merchant ships, mostly
British, entered the port in 1905. The exports are chiefly
agricultural produce, wine and fish; the imports are coal,
colonial products, and manufactured goods. Chief among the
industrial establishments is a state tobacco factory; the sardine
and herring fisheries also employ a large number of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Corunna, possibly at first a Phoenician settlement, is usually
identified with the ancient <i>Ardobrica</i>, a seaport mentioned by
the 1st-century historian, Pomponius Mela, as in the country of
the <i>Artabri</i>, from whom the name of <i>Portus Artabrorum</i> was
given to the bay on which the city is situated. In the middle
ages, and probably at an earlier period, it was called <i>Caronium</i>;
and this name is much more probably the origin of the present
designation than the Latin <i>Columna</i> which is sometimes put
forward. The harbour has always been of considerable importance,
but it is only in comparatively modern times that it has
made a figure in history. In 1588 it gave shelter to the Invincible
Armada; in 1598 the town was captured and burned by the
British under Drake and Norris. In 1747, and again in 1805,
the bay was the scene of a naval victory of the British over the
French; and on the 16th of January 1809 a battle took place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
in the neighbourhood, which is celebrated in British military
annals (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peninsular War</a></span>). The French under Marshal
Soult attempted to prevent the embarcation of the English
under Sir John Moore, but were successfully repulsed in spite of
their superior numbers. Moore was mortally wounded and
died shortly afterwards. He was hastily buried in the ramparts
near the sea; a monument in the Jardin de San Carlos raised
by the British government commemorates his death. The town
joined the revolutionary movement of 1820, but in 1823 it was
forced to capitulate by French troops. In 1836 it was captured
by the Carlists. Corunna suffered heavily when Spain was deprived
of Cuba and Porto Rico by the Spanish-American War
of 1898, for it had hitherto had a thriving trade with these
colonies.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CORVÉE,<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> in feudal law, the term used to designate the unpaid
labour due from tenants, whether free or unfree, to their lord;
hence any forced labour, especially that exacted by the state,
the word being applied both to each particular service and to the
system generally. Though the corvée formed a characteristic
feature of the feudal system, it was, as an institution, much older
than feudalism, and was already developed in its main features
under the Roman Empire. Thus, under the Roman system,
personal services (<i>operae</i>) were due from certain classes of the
population not only to the state but to private proprietors.
Apart from the obligations (<i>operae officiales</i>) imposed on freedmen
as a condition of their enfranchisement, which in the country
usually took the form of unpaid work on the landlord&rsquo;s domain,
the semi-servile <i>coloni</i> were bound, besides paying rent in money
or kind, to do a certain number of days&rsquo; unremunerated labour on
that part of the estate reserved by the landed proprietor. The
state also exacted personal labour (<i>operae publicae</i>), in lieu of
taxes, from certain classes for such purposes as the upkeep of
roads, bridges and dykes; while the inhabitants of the various
regions were responsible for the maintenance of the posting
system (<i>cursus publicus</i>), for which horses, carts or labour would
be requisitioned.</p>

<p>Under the Frankish kings, who in their administration
followed the Roman tradition, this system was preserved. Thus
for the repair of roads, or other public works, within their
jurisdiction the counts were empowered to requisition the labour
of the inhabitants of the <i>pagus</i>, while the <i>missi</i> and other
public functionaries on their travels were entitled to demand
from the population <i>en route</i> entertainment and the means of
transport for themselves and their belongings. It was, however,
the economic revolution which between the 6th and 10th centuries
converted the Gallo-Roman estates into the feudal model, and
the political conditions under which the officials of the Frankish
empire developed into hereditary feudal nobles, that evolved the
system of the corvée as it existed throughout the middle ages
and, in some countries, survived far into the 19th century.
The Roman estate had been cultivated by free farmers, by
<i>coloni</i>, and by slave labour. Under Frankish rule the farmers
became <i>coloni</i> or <i>hospites</i>, the slaves, serfs. The estate was now
habitually divided into the lord&rsquo;s domain (<i>terra indominicata</i>,
<i>dominicum</i>) and a series of allotments (<i>mansi</i>), parcels of land
distributed by lot to the cultivators of the domain, who held
them, partly by payment of rent in money or kind, partly by
personal service and labour on the domain, these obligations
both as to their nature and amount being very rigorously defined
and permanently fixed in the case of each <i>mansus</i> and passing
with the land to each new tenant. They varied, of course, very
greatly according to the size of the holding and the needs of the
particular estate, but they possessed certain common characteristics
which are everywhere found. Luchaire (<i>Manuel</i>, p. 346)
divides all corvées into two broad categories, (1) corvées properly
so called, (2) military services. The second of these, so far as the
obligation to serve in the host (<i>Hostis et equitatus</i>) is concerned,
was common to all classes of feudal society; though the obligation
of villeins to keep watch and ward (<i>gueta</i>, <i>warda</i>) and to
labour at the building or strengthening of fortifications (<i>muragium</i>,
<i>munitio castri</i>) are special corvées. We are, however, mainly
concerned with the first category, which may again be subdivided
into two main groups, (1) personal service of men and women
(<i>manoperae</i>, <i>manuum operae</i>, Fr. <i>man&oelig;uvres</i>, manual labour),
(2) carriage (<i>carroperae</i>, <i>carragia</i>, <i>carrata</i>, &amp;c., Fr. <i>charrois</i>), i.e.
service rendered by means of carts, barrows or draught animals.
These again were divided into fixed services (<i>operae rigae</i>) and
exceptional services, demanded when the others proved insufficient.
To these latter was given in the 8th century the name
of <i>operae corrogatae</i> (i.e. requisitioned works, from <i>rogare</i>, to
request.) From this term (corrupted into <i>corvatae</i>, <i>curvadae</i>,
<i>corveiae</i>, &amp;c.) is derived the word corvée, which was gradually
applied as a general term for all the various services.</p>

<p>As to the nature of these corvées it must be noted that in the
middle ages the feudal lords had replaced the centralized state
for all administrative purposes, and the services due to them
by their tenants and serfs, were partly in the nature of rent in
the form of labour, partly those which under the Roman and
Frankish monarchs had been exacted in lieu of taxes, and which
the feudal lords continued to impose as sovereigns of their
domains. To the former class belonged the service of personal
labour in the fields, of repairing buildings, felling trees, threshing
corn, and the like, as well as the hauling of corn, wine or wood;
to the latter belonged that of labouring on the roads, of building
and repairing bridges, castles and churches, and of carrying
letters and despatches. Corvées were further distinguished as
<i>real</i>, i.e. attached to certain parcels of land, and <i>personal</i>, i.e. due
from certain persons.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the corvées were usually strictly
defined by local custom and by the contracts of tenancy, and that,
in an age when currency was rare, payment in personal labour
was a convenience to the poor, the system was open to obvious
abuses. With the growth of communal life in the towns the
townsmen early managed to rid themselves of these burdensome
obligations either by purchase, or by exchanging the obligation
of personal work for that of supplying carts, draught animals and
the like. In the country, however, the system survived all but
intact; and, so far as it was modified, was modified for the worse.
Whatever safeguards the free cultivators may have possessed,
the serfs were almost everywhere&mdash;especially in the 10th and
11th centuries&mdash;actually as well as nominally in this respect at
the mercy of their lords (<i>corvéables à merci</i>), there being no limit
to the amount of money or work that could be demanded of
them. The system was oppressive even when the nobles to
whom these services were paid gave something in return, namely,
protection to the cultivator, his family and his land; they
became intolerable when the development of the modern state
deprived the land-owners of their duties, but not of their rights.
In the case of France, in the 17th century the so-called <i>corvée
royale</i> was added to the burden of the peasants, i.e. the obligation
to do unpaid labour on the public roads, an obligation made
general in 1738; and this, together with the natural resentment
of men at the fact that the land which their ancestors had bought
was still subject to burdensome personal obligations in favour
of people whom they rarely saw and from whom they derived
no benefit, was one of the most potent causes of the Revolution.
By the Constituent Assembly personal corvées were abolished
altogether, while owners of land were allowed the choice of
continuing real corvées or commuting them for money. The
corvée as an incident of land tenure has thus disappeared in
France. The <i>corvée royale</i> of repairing the roads, however,
abolished in 1789, was revived, under the name of <i>prestation</i>,
under the Consulate, by the law of 4 Thermidor an X., modified
by subsequent legislation in 1824, 1836 and 1871. Under
these laws the duty of keeping the roads in repair is still
vested in the local communities, and all able-bodied men are
called upon either to give three days&rsquo; work or its equivalent
in money to this purpose. It is precisely the same system
as that in force under the Roman Empire, and if it differ
from the corvée it is mainly in the fact that the burden is
equitably distributed, and that the work done is of actual value
to those who do it.</p>

<p>As regards other countries, the corvée was everywhere, sooner
or later, abolished with the serfdom of which it was the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
incident (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Serfdom</a></span>). Though so early as 1772 Maria Theresa
had endeavoured to mitigate its hardships in her dominions (in
Hungary unpaid labour was only to be demanded of the serfs on
52 days in the year!) it survived longest in the Austrian empire,
being finally abolished by the revolution of 1848. The duty of
personal labour on the public roads is, however, still maintained
in other countries besides France. This was formerly the case in
England also, where the occupiers of each parish who, by the
common law, had access to the roads were responsible also for
their upkeep. An act of 1555 imposed four days of forced labour
for the repair of roads, and an act of Elizabeth (5 Eliz. c. 13)
raised the number of days to six, or the payment of a composition
instead. <span class="correction" title="amended from Ths">The</span> system of turnpikes, dating from 1663, which
gradually extended over the whole of England, lessened the
burden of this system of taxation, so far as main roads were
concerned, but the greater number of the local roads were subject
to repair by statutory labour until the Highways Act 1835, by
which highways were put under the direction of a parish surveyor,
and the necessary expenses met by a rate levied on the occupiers
of land. In Scotland, statutory labour on highways was created
by an act of 1719, and abolished in 1883.</p>

<p>In Egypt, the corvée has been employed from time immemorial,
more especially for the purpose of cleaning out the irrigation
canals. In the days when only one harvest a year was reaped,
this forced labour was not a very great burden, but the introduction
of cotton and the sugar-cane under Mehemet Ali changed
the conditions. These latter are crops which require watering
at various seasons of the year, and very often the fellah was
called away for work in the canals at times when his own crops
required the utmost attention. Moreover, the inequality of
the corvée added to the evil. In some districts it was possible
to purchase exemption, and the more wealthy paid no more for
the privilege than the humblest fellah, consequently the corvée
fell with undue hardship on the poorer classes. Under the
premiership of Riaz Pasha the corvée was gradually abolished
in Egypt between the years 1888 and 1891, and a small rate on
the land substituted to provide the labour necessary for cleaning
the canals. The corvée is now employed only to a limited
extent to guard the banks of the Nile during flood.</p>

the Weser, a mile north of the town of Höxter, with which it
communicates by an avenue of lime trees. During the middle
ages it was famous for its great Benedictine abbey, which was
founded and endowed by the emperor Louis the Pious about
820, and received its name from having been first occupied by
a body of monks coming from Corbie in Picardy. The bones
of St Vitus, the patron saint of Saxony, were removed thither
according to legend in 836, but apart from this attraction, Corvey
became the centre of Christianity in Saxony and a nursery of
classical studies. The abbot was a prince of the Empire, and
Corvey was made a bishopric in 1783. In 1803 the abbey was
secularized, in 1815 its lands were given to Prussia, and in 1822
they were bestowed on Victor Amadeus, landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg,
by whom they were bequeathed, in 1834, to Prince
Victor of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, duke of Ratibor. The
abbey, which is now used as a residence, possesses a magnificent
library of 150,000 volumes especially rich in old illustrated
works, though the ancient collection due to the literary enthusiasm
of the Benedictines is no longer extant. Here in 1517 the
manuscript of the five first books of the <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus was
discovered. Here Widukind wrote his <i>Res gestae Saxonicae</i>.
Here, also, the librarian and poet Hoffmann von Fallersleben
lived and worked. The <i>Annales Corbejenses 648-1148</i> of the
monks can be read in the <i>Monumenta Germaniae historica</i>, Band

<p><span class="bold">CORVINUS, JÁNOS<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> [<span class="sc">John</span>] (1473-1504), illegitimate son of
Matthias Hunyadi, king of Hungary, and one Barbara, supposed
to be the daughter of a burgess of Breslau. He took his name
from the raven (<i>corvus</i>) in his father&rsquo;s escutcheon. Matthias
originally intended him for the Church, but on losing all hope
of offspring from his consort Queen Beatrice, determined, towards
the end of his life, to make the youth his successor on the throne.
He loaded him with honours and riches, till he was by far the
wealthiest magnate in the land. He publicly declared him his
successor, created him a prince with vast apanages in Silesia,
made the commandants of all the fortresses in the kingdom
take an oath of allegiance to him, and tried to arrange a marriage
for him with Bianca Maria Sforza of Milan, a project which was
frustrated by the intrigues of Queen Beatrice. Matthias also
intended to make the recognition of János as prince royal of
Hungary by the emperor Frederick a condition precedent of
relinquishing all or part of the conquered hereditary domains
of the house of Habsburg; but his sudden death left the matter
still pending, and the young prince suddenly found himself
alone in the midst of enemies. The inexperienced and irresolute
youth speedily became the victim of the most shameful chicanery.
He was first induced formally to resign his claims to the throne,
on the understanding that he was to be compensated with the
crown of Bosnia. He was then persuaded to retire southwards
with the royal treasures which Matthias had confided to him,
whereupon an army immediately started in pursuit, scattered
his forces, and robbed him of everything. Meanwhile the diet
had elected Vladislav of Bohemia king (July 15, 1490), to whom
János hastened to do homage, in order to save something from
the wreck of his fortunes. He was also recognized as prince of
Slavonia and duke of Troppau, but compelled to relinquish both
titles five years later. On the invasion of Hungary by Maximilian,
he shewed his loyalty to the crown by relinquishing into
the hands of Vladislav the three important fortresses of Pressburg,
Komárom and Tata, which had been entrusted to him by his
father. But now, encouraged by his complacency, the chief
dignitaries, headed by the palatine Stephen Zapolya, laid claim
to nearly all his remaining estates and involved him in a whole
series of costly processes. This they could do with perfect
impunity, as they had poisoned the mind of the indolent and
suspicious king against their victim. In 1496 Corvinus married
Beatrice, the daughter of Bernard Frangepán. His prospects
now improved, and in 1498 he was created perpetual ban of
Croatia and Slavonia. From 1499 to 1502 he successfully
defended Bosnia against the Turks, and in the following year
aspired to the dignity of palatine, but was defeated by a combination
of Queen Beatrice and his other enemies. He died on
the 12th of October 1504, leaving one son, Prince Christopher,
who died on the 17th of March 1505.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORWIN, THOMAS<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> (1794-1865), American statesman and
orator, was born in Bourbon county, Kentucky, on the 29th
of July 1794. In 1798 his father, Matthias Corwin (1761-1829),
removed to what later became Lebanon, Ohio, where the son
worked on a farm, read much, and in 1817 was admitted to
the bar. As an advocate he was at once successful, but after
1831 he devoted his attention chiefly to politics, identifying
himself first with the Whig and after 1858 with the Republican
party. He was a member of the lower house of the Ohio legislature
in 1821, 1822 and 1829, and of the national House of
Representatives from 1831 to 1840; was governor of Ohio in
1840-1842; served in the United States Senate from 1845 to
1850; was secretary of the treasury in the cabinet of President
Fillmore in 1850-1853; was again a member of the national
House of Representatives from 1859 to 1861; and from 1861
to 1864 was minister of the United States to Mexico&mdash;a position
of peculiar difficulty at that time. As a legislator he spoke
seldom, but always with great ability, his most famous speech
being that of the 11th of February 1847 opposing the Mexican
War. In 1860 he was chairman of the House &ldquo;Committee of
Thirty-three,&rdquo; consisting of one member from each state, and
appointed to consider the condition of the nation and, if possible,
to devise some scheme for reconciling the North and the South.
He is remembered chiefly as an orator. Many anecdotes have
been told to illustrate his kindliness, his inimitable humour, and
his remarkable eloquence. He died at Washington, D.C., on the
18th of December 1865.</p>

and author, son of Charles Johnson of Torrington, Devonshire,
was born on the 9th of January 1823. He was educated at
Eton and King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he gained
the chancellor&rsquo;s medal for an English poem on Plato in 1843,
and the Craven Scholarship in 1844. In 1845, after graduating
at the university, he was made an assistant master at Eton,
where he remained for some twenty-six years. He has been
called &ldquo;the most brilliant Eton tutor of his day.&rdquo; He had a
great influence on his pupils, and he defended the Etonian
system against the criticism of Matthew James Higgins. In
1872, having inherited an estate at Halsdon and assumed the
name of Cory, he left Eton. He married late in life, and after four
years spent in Madeira he settled in 1882 at Hampstead. He died
on the 11th of June 1892. He proved his genuine lyrical power
in <i>Ionica</i> (1858), which was republished with some additional
poems in 1891. He also produced <i>Lucretilis</i> (1871), a work on
the writing of Latin verses; <i>Iophon</i> (1873), on Greek Iambics;
and <i>Guide to Modern History from 1815 to 1835</i> (1882). Extracts
from the <i>Letters and Journals of William Cory</i>, which contains
much paradoxical and suggestive criticism, were edited by F.W.
Cornish and published by private subscription in 1897.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORYATE, THOMAS<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (1577?-1617), English traveller and
writer, was born at Odcombe, Somersetshire, where his father,
the Rev. George Coryate, prebendary of York Cathedral, was
rector. Educated at Westminster school and at Oxford, he
became a kind of court fool, eventually entering the household
of Prince Henry, the eldest son of James I. In 1611 he published
a curious account of a prolonged walking tour undertaken in
1608, under the title of <i>Coryate&rsquo;s Crudities hastily gobbled up
in Five Months Travels in France, Italy, &amp;c</i>. At the command
of Prince Henry, verses in mock praise of the author, and intended
originally to persuade some bookseller to undertake the
publication of the <i>Crudities</i>, were added to the volume. These
commendatory verses, written in a number of languages, and
some in a mixture of languages, by Ben Jonson, Donne, Chapman,
Drayton and others, were afterwards published (1611) by themselves
as the <i>Odcombian Banquet</i>. The book contains a clear and
interesting account of Coryate&rsquo;s travels, and, being the first of its
kind, was extremely popular. It is now very rare, and the copy
in the Chetham library is said to be the only perfect one. In the
same year was published a second volume of a similar kind,
<i>Coryats Crambe, or his Coleworte twice Sodden</i>. In 1612 he set
out on another journey, which also was mostly performed
on foot. He visited Greece, the Holy Land, Persia and
India; from Agra and Ajmere he sent home an account of his
adventures. Some of his letters were published in 1616 under the
title of <i>Letters from Asmere, the Court of the Great Mogul, to several
Persons of Quality in England</i>, and some fragments of his writings
were included in <i>Purchas his Pilgrimes</i> in 1625. Coryate was a
curious and observant traveller; he gives accounts of inscriptions
he had copied, of the antiquities of the towns he passed
through, and of manners and customs, from the Italian pronunciation
of Latin to the new-fangled use of forks. He acquired a
knowledge of Turkish, Persian and Hindustani in the course of
his travels, and on being presented by the English ambassador,
Sir Thomas Roe, to the Great Mogul, he delivered a speech in
Persian. His journeys were performed at small expense, for he
says that he spent only three pounds between Aleppo and Agra,
and often lived &ldquo;competently&rdquo; for a penny a day. Coryate died
at Surat in 1617.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Coryate&rsquo;s Crudities</i>, with his letters from India, was reprinted
from the edition of 1611 in 1776, and at the Glasgow University Press
(2 vols., 1905). The <i>Odcombian Banquet</i> was ridiculed by John
Taylor, the Water Poet, in his <i>Laugh and be Fat, or a Commentary on
the Odcombian Banket</i> (1613) and two other satires.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORYBANTES<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Korybantes">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#973;&#946;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span>), in Greek mythology, half
divine, half demonic beings, bearing the same relation to the
Asiatic Great Mother of the Gods that the Curetes bear to Rhea.
From their first appearance in literature, they are already often
identified or confused with them, and are distinguished only by
their Asiatic origin and by the more pronouncedly orgiastic nature
of their rites. Various accounts of their origin are given: they
were earth-born, sons of Cronus, sons of Zeus and Calliope, sons
of Rhea, of Ops, of the Great Mother and a mystic father, of
Apollo and Thalia, of Athena and Helios. Their names and
number were as indistinct even to the ancients as those of the
Curetes and Idaean Dactyli. Like the Curetes, Dactyli, Telchines
and Cabeiri (q.v.), however, they represent primitive gods of
procreative significance, who survived in the historic period as
subordinate deities associated with a form of the Great Mother
goddess, their relation to the Great Mother of the Gods, Cybele,
being comparable with that of Attis (q.v.). They may have been
represented or impersonated by priests in her rites as Attis
was, but they were also, like him, not actual priests in the first
instance, but objects of worship in which a frenzied dance, with
accompaniment of flute music, the beating of tambourines, the
clashing of cymbals and castanets, wild cries and self-infliction
of wounds&mdash;the whole culminating in a state of ecstasy and
exhaustion&mdash;were the most prominent features. The dance of
the Corybantic priests, like that of the priests who represented
the Curetes, may have originated in a primitive faith in the
power of noise to avert evil. Its psychic effect, both upon the
dancer and upon the mystic about whom he danced during the
initiation of the Cybele-Attis mysteries, made it a widely known
and popular feature of the cult.</p>

<p>In art the Corybantes appear, usually not more than two or
three in number, fully armed and executing their orgiastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
dance in the presence of the Great Mother, her lions and Attis.
They sometimes appear with the child Dionysus, between whose
cult and that of the Mother there was a close affinity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CORYDON,<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> a town and the county-seat of Harrison county,
Indiana, U.S.A., on Indian Creek, about 21 m. W. by S. of
Louisville, Kentucky. Pop. (1900) 1610; (1910) 1703. Corydon
is served by the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Corydon railway,
which connects at Corydon Junction, 8 m. N., with the Southern
railway. There are sulphur springs here, and the town is a
summer and health resort. Wyandotte Cave is several miles
W. of Corydon. Corydon is in an agricultural region, and there
are valuable quarries in the neighbourhood; among the town&rsquo;s
manufactures are waggons, and building and lithographic stone.
Corydon was settled about 1805, and was the capital of Indiana
Territory from 1813 to 1816, and of the state until 1824. The
convention which framed the first state constitution met here
in June 1816. The original state house, an unpretentious two-storey
stone building, is still standing. Corydon was captured
by the Confederates during Gen. Morgan&rsquo;s raid on the 9th of
July 1863.</p>

from <span class="grk" title="Eis tan Kô">&#917;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8048;&#957; &#922;&#8182;</span>), an island in that part of the Turkish archipelago
which was anciently known as the Myrtoan Sea, not far
from the south-western corner of Asia Minor, at the mouth of
the Gulf of Halicarnassus, or Bay of Budrum. Its total length is
about 25 m. and its circumference about 74. Its population is
estimated at about 10,000, of whom nearly all are Greeks.</p>

<p>A considerable chain of mountains, known to the ancients as
Oromedon, or Prion, extends along the southern coast with
hardly a break except near the island of Nisyros; so that the
greatest versant and most important streams turn towards the
north. The whole island is little more than a mass of limestone,
and consequently unites great aridity in the drier mountain
regions with the richest fertility in the alluvial districts. As the
attention of the islanders is mainly directed to the culture of
their vineyards, which yield the famous sultana raisins, a
considerable proportion of the arable land is left untouched,
though wheat, barley and maize are sown in some quarters, and
melons and sesamum seed appear among the exports. The Cos
lettuce is well known. Fruit, especially grapes, is exported in
large quantities to Egypt, mostly in local sailing boats. The
wild olive is abundant enough, but neglected; and cotton,
though it thrives well, is grown only in small quantities. As the
principal harbour, in spite of dredging operations, is fit only for
smaller vessels, the island is not of so much commercial importance
as it would otherwise be; but since 1868 it has been
regularly visited by steamers. The only town in the island is Cos,
or Stanko, at the eastern extremity, remarkable for its fortress,
founded by the knights of Rhodes, and for the gigantic plane-tree
in the public square. The fortress preserves in its walls a
number of interesting architectural fragments. The plane-tree
has a circumference of about 30 ft., and its huge and heavy
branches have to be supported by pillars; of its age there is no
certain knowledge, but the popular tradition connects it with
Hippocrates. The town is supplied by an aqueduct, about 4 m.
in length, with water from a hot chalybeate spring, which is
likewise named after the great physician of the island. The
villages of Pyli and Kephalas are interesting, the former for the
Greek tomb of a certain Charmylos, and the latter for a castle of
the knights of St John and the numerous inscriptions that prove
that it occupies the site of the chief town of the ancient deme of
Isthmos. The most interesting site on the island is the precinct
of Asclepius, which was excavated in 1900-1904 on the slope of
Mount Prion, about 2 m. from the town of Cos. It consists of
three terraces, the uppermost containing a temple, a cypress
grove and porticoes; the middle, which is the earliest portion,
two or three temples, an altar, and other buildings; and the
lower a kind of sacred agora enclosed by porticoes. The precinct
had been enlarged and reconstructed at various times. The
earliest buildings on the middle terrace probably date from the
6th century B.C. The temple on the upper terrace, with the
imposing flight of steps by which it is approached, seems to
belong to the 2nd century B.C. when the whole precinct was
enlarged and reconstructed. After a destructive earthquake, the
whole appears to have been rebuilt by Xenophon, the physician
and poisoner of the emperor Claudius. The final destruction was
brought about by the earthquake of A.D. 554. Among other
things the precinct contains a fountain of water with medicinal
properties. It is doubtful whether this water is brought from
Burinna, the famous fountain of Hippocrates in the mountain
above.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Cos was a Dorian colony with a large contingent of
settlers from Epidaurus who took with them their Asclepius
cult and made their new home famous for its sanatoria. The
other chief sources of the island&rsquo;s wealth lay in its wines, and in
later days, in its silk manufacture. Its early history is obscure.
During the Persian wars it was ruled by tyrants, but as a rule it
seems to have been under an oligarchic government. In the 5th
century it joined the Delian League, and after the revolt of
Rhodes served as the chief Athenian station in the south-eastern
Aegean (411-407). In 366 a democracy was instituted. After
helping, in the Social War (357-355), to weaken Athenian
power it fell for a few years to the Carian prince Maussollus.
In the Hellenistic age Cos attained the zenith of its prosperity.
Its alliance was valued by the kings of Egypt, who used it as
an outpost for their navy to watch the Aegean. As a seat ef
learning it rose to be a kind of provincial branch of the museum of
Alexandria, and became a favourite resort for the education of
the princes of the Ptolemaic dynasty; among its most famous
sons were the physician Hippocrates, the painter Apelles, the
poets Philetas and, perhaps, Theocritus (q.v.). Following the
lead of its great neighbour, Rhodes, Cos generally displayed a
friendly attitude towards the Romans; in A.D. 53 it was made a
free city. In A.D. 1315 it was occupied by the Knights of St
John; in 1523 it passed under Ottoman sway. Except for
occasional incursions by corsairs and some severe earthquakes
the island has rarely had its peace disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSA,<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> an ancient city of Etruria, on the S.W. coast of Italy,
close to the Via Aurelia, 4½ m. E.S.E. of the modern town of
Orbetello. Apparently it was not an independent Etruscan
town, but was founded as a colony by the Romans in the territory
of the Volceientes, whom they had recently conquered, in 273
B.C. The town was strongly fortified, and the walls, about a mile
in circuit, with three gates, and seventeen projecting rectangular
towers at intervals, are in places preserved to a height of over
30 ft. on the outside, and 15 on the inside. The lower part is
built of polygonal, the upper of rectangular, blocks, and the
masonry is of equal fineness all through, so that a difference of
date cannot be assumed; such a change of technique is not
without parallel in Greece (F. Noack in <i>Römische Mitteilungen</i>,
1897, 194). Within the city no remains are visible. The place
was of importance as a fortress; it was approached by a branch
road which diverged from the Via Aurelia at the post station of
Succosa, at the foot of the hill on which the town stood. The
harbour, too, was of some importance. In the 5th century we
hear of it as deserted, and in the 9th a town called Ansedonia
took its place for a short time, but itself soon perished, though it
has left its name to the ruins.</p>

<p>The first record of Cosel dates from 1286. From 1306 to 1359
it was the seat of an independent duchy held by a cadet line of the
dukes of Teschen. In 1532 it fell to the emperor, was several times
besieged during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and came into Prussian
possession by the treaty of Breslau in 1742. Frederick II.
converted it into a fortress, which was besieged in vain by the
Austrians in 1758, 1759, 1760 and 1762. In 1807 it withstood
another siege, by the Bavarian allies of Napoleon. The fortifications
were razed and their site converted into promenades in 1874.</p>

the Neapolitan army he took part in the expedition sent by
Ferdinand II. against the Austrians in 1848; but after the
<i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> at Naples he followed General Guglielmo Pepe in
disobeying Ferdinand&rsquo;s order for the withdrawal of the troops,
and proceeded to Venice to aid in defending that city. As
commandant of the fort of Marghera, Cosenz displayed distinguished
valour, and after the fall of the fort assumed the
defence of the Piazzale, where he was twice wounded. Upon the
fall of Venice he fled to Piedmont, where he remained until, in
1859, he assumed the command of a Garibaldian regiment. In
1860 he conducted the third Garibaldian expedition to Sicily,
defeated two Neapolitan brigades at Piale (August 23), and
marched victoriously upon Naples, where he was appointed
minister of war, and took part in organizing the <i>plébiscite</i>.
During the war of 1866 his division saw but little active service.
After the war he repeatedly declined the portfolio of war. In

on the E. coast railway between Metaponto and Reggio. Pop.
(1901) town, 13,841; commune, 20,857. It is situated on the
slope of a hill between the Crati and Busento, just above the
junction, and is commanded by a castle (1250 ft.). The Gothic
cathedral, consecrated in 1222, on the site of another ruined by an
earthquake in 1184, goes back to French models in Champagne,
and is indeed unique in Italy. It contains the Gothic tomb of
Isabella of Aragon, wife of Philip III. of France, and also the
tomb of Louis III., duke of Anjou; but it has been spoilt by
restoration both inside and out. S. Domenico has a fine rose
window. The Palazzo del Tribunale (law courts) is a fine
building, and the upper town contains several good houses of
rich proprietors of the province; while the lower portion is
unhealthy. Earthquakes, and a fire in 1901, have done considerable
damage to the town.</p>

<p>The ancient Consentia is first named as the burial place of
Alexander of Epirus in about 330 B.C. In 204 it became Roman,
though it was more under the influence of Greek culture. It is
mentioned by Strabo as the chief town of the Bruttii, and
frequently spoken of in classical authors as an important place.
It lay on the Via Popillia. Varro speaks of its apple trees which
gave fruit twice in the year and Pliny praises its wine also. It
is the more surprising that in the whole of its territory no inscriptions,
either Greek or Latin, have ever been found, those
that are recorded by some writers being fabrications. in A.D. 410
Alaric fell in battle here and was buried, it is said, in the bed of
the Busento, which was temporarily diverted and then allowed
to resume its natural course. Cosenza became an archbishopric
in the 11th century. In 1461 it was taken by Roberto Orsini,
and suffered severely. It was the home of a scientific academy
founded by the philosopher Bernardino Telesio (1509-1588).
In 1555-1561 it was the centre of the persecution by the Inquisition
of the Waldenses who had settled there towards the end of
the 14th century.</p>

year archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire. In 1628 he
took his degree of D.D. He first became known as an author in
1627, when he published his <i>Collection of Private Devotions</i>, a
manual stated to have been prepared by command of Charles I.,
for the use of the queen&rsquo;s maids of honour.<a name="FnAnchor_1n" id="FnAnchor_1n" href="#Footnote_1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> This book, together
with his insistence on points of ritual in his cathedral church and
his friendship with Laud, exposed him to the suspicions and
hostility of the Puritans; and the book was rudely handled by
William Prynne and Henry Burton. In 1628 Cosin took part
in the prosecution of a brother prebendary, Peter Smart, for a
sermon against high church practices; and the prebendary was
deprived. In 1634 Cosin was appointed master of Peterhouse,
Cambridge; and in 1640 he became vice-chancellor of the university.
In October of this year he was promoted to the deanery
of Peterborough. A few days before his installation the Long
Parliament had met; and among the complainants who hastened
to appeal to it for redress was the ex-prebendary, Smart. His
petition against the new dean was considered; and early in 1641
Cosin was sequestered from his benefices. Articles of impeachment,
were, two months later, presented against him, but he
was dismissed on bail, and was not again called for. For sending
the university plate to the king, he was deprived of the mastership
of Peterhouse (1642). He thereupon withdrew to France, preached
at Paris, and served as chaplain to some members of the household
of the exiled royal family. At the Restoration he returned
to England, was reinstated in the mastership, restored to all his
benefices, and in a few months raised to the see of Durham
(December 1660). At the convocation in 1661 he played a
prominent part in the revision of the prayer-book, and endeavoured
with some success to bring both prayers and rubrics into completer
agreement with ancient liturgies. He administered his
diocese with conspicuous ability and success for about eleven
years; and applied a large share of his revenues to the promotion
of the interests of the Church, of schools and of charitable
institutions. He died in London on the 15th of January 1672.</p>

<p>Cosin occupies an interesting and peculiar position among the
churchmen of his time. Though a ritualist and a rigorous
enforcer of outward conformity, he was uncompromisingly
hostile to Roman Catholicism, and most of his writings illustrate
this antagonism. In France he was on friendly terms with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
Huguenots, justifying himself on the ground that their non-episcopal
ordination had not been of their own seeking, and at
the Savoy conference in 1661 he tried hard to effect a reconciliation
with the Presbyterians. He differed from the majority of his
colleagues in his strict attitude towards Sunday observance
and in favouring, in the case of adultery, both divorce and the
re-marriage of the innocent party. He was a genial companion,
frank and outspoken, and a good man of business.</p>

<p>Among his writings (most of which were published posthumously)
are a <i>Historia Transubstantiationis Papalis</i> (1675), <i>Notes and Collections
on the Book of Common Prayer</i> (1710) and <i>A Scholastical History
of the Canon of Holy Scripture</i> (1657). A collected edition of his

<p><span class="bold">COSMAS,<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> of Alexandria, surnamed from his maritime experiences
<i>Indicopleustes</i>, merchant and traveller, flourished
during the 6th century A.D. The surname is inaccurate, since
he never reached India proper; further, it is doubtful whether
Cosmas is a family name, or merely refers to his reputation as a
cosmographer. In his earlier days he had sailed on the Red Sea
and the Indian Ocean, visiting Abyssinia and Socotra and
apparently also the Persian Gulf, western India and Ceylon.
He subsequently became a monk, and about 548, in the retirement
of a Sinai cloister, wrote a work called <i>Topographia
Christiana</i>. Its chief object is to denounce the false and heathen
doctrine of the rotundity of the earth, and to vindicate the
scriptural account of the world. Photius, who had read it,
calls it a &ldquo;commentary on the Octateuch&rdquo; (meaning the eight
books of Ptolemy&rsquo;s great geographical work; according to some,
the first eight books of the Old Testament). According to
Cosmas the earth is a rectangular plane, covered by the vaulted
roof of the firmament, above which lies heaven. In the centre of
the plane is the inhabited earth, surrounded by ocean, beyond
which lies the paradise of Adam. The sun revolves round a
conical mountain to the north&mdash;round the summit in summer,
round the base in winter, which accounts for the difference in
the length of the day. Cosmas is supposed by some to have been
a Nestorian. Although not to be commended from a theological
standpoint, the <i>Topographia</i> contains some curious information.
Especially to be noticed is the description of a marble seat
discovered by him at Adulis (Zula) in Abyssinia, with two
inscriptions recounting the heroic deeds and military successes
of Ptolemy Euergetes and an Axumitic king. It also contains
in all probability the oldest Christian maps. From allusions
in the <i>Topographia</i> Cosmas seems to have been the author of a
larger cosmography, a treatise on the motions of the stars,
and commentaries on the Psalms and Canticles. Photius (<i>Cod.</i>
36) speaks contemptuously of the style and language of Cosmas,
and throws doubt upon his truthfulness. But the author
himself expressly disclaims any claims to literary elegance, which
in fact he considers unsuited to a Christian circle of readers, and
the accuracy of his statements has been confirmed by later
travellers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSMATI,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> the name of a Roman family, seven members of
which, for four generations, were skilful architects, sculptors and
workers in mosaic. The following are the names and dates
known from existing inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Their principal works in Rome are: ambones of S. Maria in
Ara Coeli (Lorenzo); door of S. Saba, 1205, and door with
mosaics of S. Tommaso in Formis (Jacopo); chapel of the
Sancta Sanctorum, by the Lateran (Cosimo); pavement of S.
Jacopo alla Lungara, and (probably) the magnificent episcopal
throne and choir-screen in S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura, of 1254
(Jacopo the younger); baldacchino of the Lateran and of S.
Maria in Cosmedin, c. 1294 (Adeodato); tombs in S. Maria
sopra Minerva (c. 1296), in S. Maria Maggiore, and in S. Balbina
(Giovanni). The chief signed works by Jacopo the younger
and his brother Luca are at Anagni and Subiaco. A large
number of other works by members and pupils of the same
family, but unsigned, exist in Rome. These are mainly altars
and baldacchini, choir-screens, paschal candlesticks, ambones,
tombs and the like, all enriched with sculpture and glass mosaic
of great brilliance and decorative effect.</p>

<p>Besides the more mechanical sort of work, such as mosaic
patterns and architectural decoration, they also produced
mosaic pictures and sculpture of very high merit, especially the
recumbent effigies, with angels standing at the head and foot,
in the tombs of Ara Coeli, S. Maria Maggiore and elsewhere.
One of their finest works is in S. Cesareo; this is a marble altar
richly decorated with mosaic in sculptured panels, and (below)
two angels drawing back a curtain (all in marble) so as to expose
the open grating of the confessio. The magnificent cloisters of S.
Paolo fuori le Mura, built about 1285 by Giovanni, the youngest
of the Cosmati, are one of the most beautiful works of this school.
The baldacchino of the same basilica is a signed work of the
Florentine Arnolfo del Cambio, 1285, &ldquo;cum suo socio Petro,&rdquo;
probably a pupil of the Cosmati. Other works of Arnolfo, such
as the Braye tomb at Orvieto (q.v.), show an intimate artistic
alliance between him and the Cosmati. The equally magnificent
cloisters of the Lateran, of about the same date, are very similar
in design; both these triumphs of the sculptor-architect&rsquo;s and
mosaicist&rsquo;s work have slender marble columns, twisted or straight,
richly inlaid with bands of glass mosaic in delicate and brilliant
patterns. The shrine of the Confessor at Westminster is a work of
this school, executed about 1268. The general style of works of
the Cosmati school is Gothic in its main lines, especially in the
elaborate altar-canopies, with their pierced geometrical tracery.
In detail, however, they differ widely from the purer Gothic
of northern countries. The richness of effect which the English
or French architect obtained by elaborate and carefully worked
mouldings was produced in Italy by the beauty of polished
marbles and jewel-like mosaics&mdash;the details being mostly rather
coarse and often carelessly executed.</p>

the universe, universal or orderly. In ancient astronomy, the
word &ldquo;cosmical&rdquo; means occurring at sunrise, and designates
especially the rising or setting of the stars at that time.
&ldquo;Cosmical physics&rdquo; is a term broadly applied to the totality
of those branches of science which treat of cosmical phenomena
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
and their explanation by the laws of physics. It includes
terrestrial magnetism, the tides, meteorology as related to
cosmical causes, the aurora, meteoric phenomena, and the
physical constitution of the heavenly bodies generally. It
differs from astrophysics only in dealing principally with
phenomena in their wider aspects, and as the products of physical
causes, while astrophysics is more concerned with minute details
of observation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSMOGONY<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="kosmos">&#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>, world and <span class="grk" title="gignesthai">&#947;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>, to be
born), a theory, however incomplete, of the origin of heaven and
earth, such as is produced by primitive races in the myth-making
age, and is afterwards expanded and systematized by priests,
poets or philosophers. Such a theory must be mythical in form,
and, after gods have arisen, is likely to be a theogony (<span class="grk" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</span>, god)
as well as a cosmogony (Babylonia, Egypt, Phoenicia, Polynesia).</p>

<p>1. To many the interest of such stories will depend on their
parallelism to the Biblical account in Genesis i.; the anthropologist,
however, will be attracted by them in proportion as they
illustrate the more primitive phases of human culture. In spite
of the frequent overgrowth of a luxuriant imagination, the leading
ideas of really primitive cosmogonies are extremely simple.
Creation out of nothing is nowhere thought of, for this is not at
all a simple idea. The pre-existence of world-matter is assumed;
sometimes too that of heaven, as the seat of the
earth-maker,
and that of preternatural animals, his coadjutors. The earth-making
process may, among the less advanced races, be begun
by a bird, or some other animal (whence the term &ldquo;theriomorphism&rdquo;),
for the high idea of a god is impossible, till man
has fully realized his own humanity. Of course, the earth-forming
animal is a preternaturally gifted one, and is on the line
of development towards that magnified man who, in a later
stage, becomes the demiurge.<a name="FnAnchor_1o" id="FnAnchor_1o" href="#Footnote_1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Between the two comes the
animal&mdash;man, i.e. a being who has not yet shed the slough of
an animal shape, but combines the powers&mdash;natural and preternatural&mdash;of
some animal with those of a man. Let us now
collect specimens of the evidence for different varieties of cosmogony,
ranging from those of the Red Indian tribes to that
of the people of Israel.</p>

<p>2. <i>North American Stories.</i>&mdash;Theriomorphic creators are most
fully attested for the Red Indian tribes, whose very backwardness
renders them so valuable to an anthropologist. There is a
painted image from Alaska, now in the museum of the university
of Pennsylvania, which represents such an one. We see a black
crow tightly holding a human mask which he is in the act of
incubating. Let us pass on to the Thlinkît Indians of the N.W.
coast. A cycle of tales is devoted to a strange humorous being
called Yehl or Yelch, i.e. the Raven, miraculously born, not to
be wounded, and at once a semi-developed creator and a culture
hero.<a name="FnAnchor_2o" id="FnAnchor_2o" href="#Footnote_2o"><span class="sp">2</span></a> His bitter foe is his uncle; the germs of dualism appear
early. Like some other culture-heroes, he steals sun, moon and
stars out of a box, so enlightening the dark earth. These people
are at any rate above the Greenlanders, but are surpassed by
the Algonkins described by Nicholas Perrot in 1700, and by the
Iroquois, whom the heroic Father Brébeuf (1593-1649) learned
to know so well.<a name="FnAnchor_3o" id="FnAnchor_3o" href="#Footnote_3o"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The earth-maker of the former was called
Michabo, i.e. the Great Hare.<a name="FnAnchor_4o" id="FnAnchor_4o" href="#Footnote_4o"><span class="sp">4</span></a> He is the leader of some animals
on a raft on a shoreless sea. Three of these in succession are
sent to dive for a little earth. A grain of sand is brought; out
of it he makes an island (America?). Of the carcases of the
dead animals he makes the present men (N. Americans?). There
is also a Flood-story, an episode in which has a bearing on the
great dragon-myth<a name="FnAnchor_5o" id="FnAnchor_5o" href="#Footnote_5o"><span class="sp">5</span></a> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Deluge</a></span>). The Iroquois are in advance
of the Algonkins; their creator-hero has no touch of the animal
in him. Above the waters there existed a heaven, or a heavenly
earth (cf. Mexico, Babylonia, Egypt), through a hole in which
Aataentsic fell to the water. The broad back of a tortoise
(cf. § 6) on which a diving animal had placed some mud, received
her. Here, being already pregnant, she gave birth to a daughter,
who in turn bore the twins Joskeha and Tawiscara (myth of
hostile brothers). By his violence (cf. Gen. xxv. 22) the latter
killed his mother, out of whose corpse grew plants. Tawiscara
fled to the west, where he rules over the dead. Joskeha made the
beasts and also men. After acting as culture-giver he disappeared
to the east, where he is said to dwell with his grandmother as
her husband.<a name="FnAnchor_6o" id="FnAnchor_6o" href="#Footnote_6o"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>3. <i>Mexican.</i>&mdash;The most interesting feature in the Mexican
cosmology is the theory of the ages of the world. Greece, Persia
and probably Babylon, knew of four such ages.<a name="FnAnchor_7o" id="FnAnchor_7o" href="#Footnote_7o"><span class="sp">7</span></a> The Priestly
Writer in the Pentateuch also appears to be acquainted with this
doctrine; it is the first of four ages which begins with the
Creation and ends with the Deluge. The Mexicans, however, are
said to have assumed five ages called &ldquo;suns.&rdquo; The first was the
sun of earth; the second, of fire; the third, of air; the fourth,
of water; the fifth (which is the present) was unnamed. Each
of these closed with a physical catastrophe.<a name="FnAnchor_8o" id="FnAnchor_8o" href="#Footnote_8o"><span class="sp">8</span></a> The speculations
which underlie the Mexican theory have not come down to us.
For the Iranian parallel, see § 8, and on the Hebrew Priestly
Writer, Gunkel, <i>Genesis</i>[2], pp. 233 ff.</p>

<p>4. <i>Peruvian.</i>&mdash;In Peru, as in Egypt, the sun-god obtained
universal homage. But there were creator-gods in the background.
A theoretical supremacy was accorded by the Incas to
Pachacamac, whose worship, like that of Viracocha, they appear
to have already found when they conquered the land.
Pachacamac means, in Quichua, &ldquo;world-animator.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_9o" id="FnAnchor_9o" href="#Footnote_9o"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The
&ldquo;philosophers&rdquo; of Peru declared that he desired no temples or
sacrifices, no worship but that of the heart. This is conceivable;
Maui, too, in New Zealand had no temple or priests. But most
probably this deity had another less abstract name, and the
horrible worship offered in the one temple which he really had
under the Incas, accorded with his true cosmic significance as the
god of the subterranean fire. Viracocha too had a cosmic
position; an old Peruvian hymn calls him &ldquo;world-former,
world-animator.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_10o" id="FnAnchor_10o" href="#Footnote_10o"><span class="sp">10</span></a> He was connected with water. A third
creator was Manco Capac (&ldquo;the mighty man&rdquo;), whose sister and
wife is called Mama Oello, &ldquo;the mother-egg.&rdquo; Afterwards, the
creator and the mother-egg became respectively the sun and the
moon, represented by the Inca priest-king and his wife, the
supposed descendants of Manco Capac.<a name="FnAnchor_11o" id="FnAnchor_11o" href="#Footnote_11o"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Dualistic tendencies
were also developed. Las Casas<a name="FnAnchor_12o" id="FnAnchor_12o" href="#Footnote_12o"><span class="sp">12</span></a> reports a story that before
creation the creator-god had a bad son who sought, after creation,
to undo all that his father had done. Angered at this, his father
hurled him into the sea. We need not suspect Christian influences,
but the parallelism of Rev. xx. 3, Isa. xiv. 12, 15, Ezek.
xxviii. 16 is obvious.</p>

<p>5. <i>Polynesian.</i>&mdash;Polynesia, that classic land of mythology, is
specially rich in myths of creation. The Maori story, told by
Grey and others, of the rending apart of Rangi ( = Langi, heaven)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
and Papa (earth) can be paralleled in China, India and Greece,
and more remotely in Egypt and Babylonia. The son of Rangi
and Papa was Tangaloa (also called Tangaroa and Taaroa), the
sea-god and the father of fishes and reptiles.<a name="FnAnchor_13o" id="FnAnchor_13o" href="#Footnote_13o"><span class="sp">13</span></a> In other parts of
Polynesia he is the Heaven God, to whom there is no like, no
second. In Samoa he is even called Tangaloa-Langi (Tangaloa =
heaven). And if he is the sea-god, we must remember that there is
a heavenly as well as an earthly ocean; hence the clouds are
sometimes called Tangaloa&rsquo;s ships. It is true, the popular
imagery is unworthy of such a god. Sometimes he is said to live
in a shell, by throwing off which from time to time he increases
the world; or in an egg, which at last he breaks in pieces; the
pieces are the islands. We also hear that long ago he hovered as
an enormous bird over the waters, and there deposited an egg.
The egg may be either the earth with the overarching vault of
heaven or (as in Egypt&mdash;but this is a later view) the sun. The
latter received mythical representation in that most interesting
god (but originally rather culture-hero) Maui, who, in New Zealand
practically supplants Tangaloa, and becomes the god of the air
and of the heaven, the creator and the causer of the flood.<a name="FnAnchor_14o" id="FnAnchor_14o" href="#Footnote_14o"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
Speculation opened the usual deep problem; whence came the
gods? It was answered that Po, i.e. darkness, was the begetter
of all things, even of Tangaloa.</p>

<p>6. <i>Indian.</i>&mdash;India, however, is the natural home of a mythology
recast by speculation. The classical specimen of an advanced
cosmogony is to be found in the Rig Veda (x. 129); it is the hymn
which begins, &ldquo;There then was neither Aught nor Naught!&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_15o" id="FnAnchor_15o" href="#Footnote_15o"><span class="sp">15</span></a>
Another such cosmogony is given in Manu. It is &ldquo;the self-existent
Lord,&rdquo; who, &ldquo;with a thought, created the waters, and
deposited in them a seed which became a golden egg, in which egg
he himself is born as Brahm&#257;, the progenitor of the worlds.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_16o" id="FnAnchor_16o" href="#Footnote_16o"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
The doctrine of creation by a thought is characteristically Indian.
In the &#351;atapatha Brahmana (cf. <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Deluge</a></span>), we meet again with
the primeval waters and the world-egg, and with the famous
mythological tortoise-theory,<a name="FnAnchor_17o" id="FnAnchor_17o" href="#Footnote_17o"><span class="sp">17</span></a> also found among the Algonkins
(§ 2)&mdash;antique beliefs gathered up by the framers of philosophic
systems, who felt the importance of maintaining such links with
the distant past.</p>

<p>7. <i>Egyptian.</i>&mdash;In Egypt too the systematizers were busily
engaged in the co-ordination of myths. They retained the
belief that the germs of all things slept for ages within the dark
flood, personified as Nûn or Nû. How they were drawn forth
was variously told.<a name="FnAnchor_18o" id="FnAnchor_18o" href="#Footnote_18o"><span class="sp">18</span></a> In some districts the demiurge was called
Khn&#363;mu; it was he who modelled the egg (of the world?) and
also man.<a name="FnAnchor_19o" id="FnAnchor_19o" href="#Footnote_19o"><span class="sp">19</span></a> Elsewhere he was the artizan-god Pta&#7717;, who with his
hammer broke the egg; sometimes Thoth, the moon-god and
principle of intelligence, who spoke the world into existence.<a name="FnAnchor_20o" id="FnAnchor_20o" href="#Footnote_20o"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
A strange episode in the legend of the destruction of man by the
gods tells how Ra (or Re), the first king of the world, finding in his
old age that mankind ceased to respect him, first tried the remedy
of massacre, and then ascended the heavenly cow, and organized
a new world&mdash;that of heaven.<a name="FnAnchor_21o" id="FnAnchor_21o" href="#Footnote_21o"><span class="sp">21</span></a></p>

<p>8. <i>Iranian.</i>&mdash;The Iranian account of creation<a name="FnAnchor_22o" id="FnAnchor_22o" href="#Footnote_22o"><span class="sp">22</span></a> is specially
interesting because its religious spirit is akin to that of Genesis i.
From a literary point of view, indeed, it cannot compare with the
dignified Hebrew narrative, but considering the misfortunes
which have befallen the collection of Zoroastrian traditions now
represented by the Bundahish (the Parsee Genesis) we cannot
reasonably be surprised. The work referred to begins by
describing the state of things in the beginning; the good spirit
in endless light and omniscient, and the evil spirit in endless
darkness and with limited knowledge. Both produced their own
creatures, which remained apart, in a spiritual or ideal state, for
3000 years, after which the evil spirit began his opposition to the
good creation under an agreement that his power was not to last
more than 9000 years, of which only the middle 3000 were to see
him successful. By uttering a sacred formula the good spirit
throws the evil one into a state of confusion for a second 3000
years, while he produces the archangels and the material creation,
including the sun, moon and stars. At the end of that period the
evil spirit, encouraged by the demons he had produced, once
more rushes upon the good creation to destroy it. The demons
carry on conflicts with each of the six classes of creation, namely,
the sky, water, earth, plants, animals represented by the primeval
ox, and mankind represented by G&#257;y&#333;mard or Kayumarth (the
&ldquo;first man&rdquo; of the <i>Avesta</i>).<a name="FnAnchor_23o" id="FnAnchor_23o" href="#Footnote_23o"><span class="sp">23</span></a> Four points to be noticed here: (1)
the belief in the four periods of the world, each of 3000 years
(cf. § 3); (2) the comparative success for a time of Angra
Mainyu (the evil principle personified); (3) the absence of any
recognition of pre-existent matter; (4) the mention of six
classes of good creatures. Each of these deserves a comment
which we cannot, however, here give, and the third may seem
to suggest direct influence of the Iranian upon the Jewish
cosmogony. But though there are in Gen. i. six days of creative
activity, and the creative works are not six, but eight, if not ten
in number, and indirect Babylonian influence is more strongly
indicated. Jewish thinkers would have been attracted by the
emphatic assertion of the creatorship of the One God in the
royal Persian inscriptions more than by the traditional
cosmogony. See further <i>Ency. Bib.</i>, &ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; § 9.</p>

<p>9. <i>Phoenician and Greek.</i>&mdash;Phoenician cosmogonies would
appear, from the notices which have come down to us,<a name="FnAnchor_24o" id="FnAnchor_24o" href="#Footnote_24o"><span class="sp">24</span></a> to have
been composite. The traditions are pale and obscure. It is
clear, however, that the primeval flood and the world-egg
(out of which came heaven and earth) are referred to. See
<i>Ency. Bib.</i>, &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; § 7; &ldquo;Phoenicia&rdquo; § 15; Lagrange,
<i>Religions sémitiques</i>, pp. 351 ff. Greek cosmogonies (the
orientalism of which is clear) will be found in Hesiod, <i>Theog.</i>
116 ff.; Aristophanes, <i>Birds</i>, 692 ff.; cf. Clem. Rom., <i>Homil.</i> vi. 4.
See Miss Harrison, <i>Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion</i>,
chap. xii, &ldquo;Orphic Cosmogony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>10. <i>Babylonian and Israelitish.</i>&mdash;Of the Babylonian and
Israelitish cosmogonies we have several more or less complete
records. For details as to the former, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Babylonian and
Assyrian Religion</a></span>. With regard to the latter, we may notice that
in Gen. ii. 4b-25 we have an account of creation which, though in
its present form very incomplete, is highly attractive, because it is
pervaded by a breath from primitive times. It has, however,
been interwoven with an account of the Garden of Eden from
some other source (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Eden</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paradise</a></span>), and perhaps in order
to concentrate the attention of the reader, the description of the
origin of &ldquo;earth and heaven&rdquo; as well as of the plants and of the
rain, appears to have been omitted. In fact, both the creation-stories
at the opening of Genesis must have undergone much
editorial manipulation. Originally, for instance, Gen. i. 26
must have said that man was made out of earth; this point of
contact between the two cosmogonic traditions has, however,
been effaced.</p>

<p>The other narrative, Gen. i. 1-ii. 4a, is a much more complete
cosmogony, and since the theory of P. A. Lagarde (1887), which
ascribes it to Iranian influence (see § 8), has no very solid ground,
whereas the theory which explains it as largely Babylonian is in
a high degree plausible, we must now consider the relations
between the Israelitish and Babylonian cosmogonies. The short
account of creation first translated in 1890 by T. G. Pinches is
distinguished by its non-mythical character; in particular, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
dragon of chaos and darkness is conspicuous by her absence.
This may illustrate the fact that the dragon is also unmentioned
in the Hebrew cosmogony; to some writers the dragon-element
may have seemed grotesque and inappropriate. We must,
however, study this element in the most important Babylonian
tradition, even if only for its relation to non-Semitic myths and
especially to some striking passages in the Bible (Isa. xxvii. 1, li.
9b; Ps. lxxiv. 14, lxxxix. 10, 11; Job iii. 8, ix. 13, xxvi. 12, 13;
Rev. xii. 3, 4, xx. 1-3). One may also be permitted to hold that
the mythic figure of the dragon, if used poetically, is a highly
serviceable one, and consider that &ldquo;in the beginning God fought
with the dragon, and slew him&rdquo; would have formed an admirable
illustration of the passages just now referred to, especially to
those in the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>The student should, however, notice that the dragon-element
is not entirely unrepresented even in the priestly Hebrew cosmogony.
It is said in Gen. i. 9, 10, 14, 15, that God divided the
primeval waters into two parts by an intervening &ldquo;firmament&rdquo;
or &ldquo;platform,&rdquo; on which the sun, moon and stars (planets) were
placed to mark times and to give light. This division (cp.
Ps. lxxiv. 13) is really a pale version of the old mythic statement
respecting the cleaving of the carcase of Ti&#257;mat (the Dragon)
into two parts, one of which kept the upper waters from coming
down.<a name="FnAnchor_25o" id="FnAnchor_25o" href="#Footnote_25o"><span class="sp">25</span></a> And we must affirm that the technical term <i>t&#277; h&#333;m</i>
(rendered in the English Bible &ldquo;the deep&rdquo;), which evidently
signifies the enveloping primeval flood, and which closely
resembles Ti&#257;mat, the name given to the dragon or serpent in
the epic (cf. <i>tiamtu</i> and <i>tamtu</i>, Babylonian words for &ldquo;the
ocean&rdquo;), can only be due to the influence&mdash;probably the very
early influence&mdash;of Babylonia.</p>

<p>But we are far from having exhausted the evidence of Babylonian
influence on the Hebrew cosmogony. The description of
chaos in v. 2 not only mentions the great water (<i>t&#277;h&#333;m</i>), but the
earth, i.e. the earth-matter, out of which the earth and (potentially)
its varied products (vv. 9-11), and (as we know from the
Babylonian epic) the &ldquo;firmament&rdquo; or &ldquo;platform&rdquo; of the
heaven were to appear. This earth-matter is called &ldquo;<i>t&#333;hu</i> and
<i>b&#333;hu</i>&rdquo;; there is nothing like this phrase in the epic, but we may
infer from Jer. iv. 23, where the same phrase occurs, that it
means &ldquo;devoid of living things.&rdquo; For a commentary on this see
the opening of the Babylonian account referred to above, which
refers to the period of chaos as one in which there were neither
reeds nor trees, and where &ldquo;the lands altogether were sea.&rdquo;
As to the creative acts, we may admit that the creation of light
does not form one of them in the epic (cf. Gen. i. 3), but the
existence of light apart from the sun is presupposed; Marduk
the creator is in fact a god of light. Nor ought we to find a
discrepancy between the Babylonian and the Hebrew accounts
in the creation of the heavenly bodies after the plants, related
in Gen. i. 14-18. For the position of this creative act is due to the
necessity of bringing all the divine acts into the framework of
six working days. On the whole, the Hebrew statement of
the successive stages of creation corresponds so nearly to that in
the Babylonian epic that we are bound to assume that one has
been influenced by the other. And if we are asked, &ldquo;Which is the
more original?&rdquo; we answer by appealing to the well-established
fact of the profound influence of Babylonian culture upon Canaan
in remote times (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Canaan</a></span>). An important element in this
culture would be mythic representations of the origin of things,
such as the Babylonian Creation and Deluge-stories in various
forms. Indeed, not only Canaan but all the neighbouring
regions must have been pervaded by Babylonian views of the
universe and its origin. Myths of origins there must indeed have
been in those countries before Babylonian influence became so
overpowering, but, if so, these myths must have become recast
when the great Teacher of the Nations half-attracted and half-compelled
attention. More than this we need not assert.
Zimmern&rsquo;s somewhat different treatment of the subject in <i>Ency.
Biblica</i>, &ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; § 4, may be compared.</p>

<p>Popular writers are in some danger of misrepresenting this
important result. It is tempting, but incorrect, to suppose that
a docile Israelitish writer accepted one of the chief forms of the
Babylonian cosmogony, merely omitting its polytheism and
substituting &ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo; for &ldquo;Marduk.&rdquo; As we have seen,
various myths of Creation may have been current both in N.
Arabia (whence the Israelites may have come) and in Canaan
prior to the great extension of Babylonian influence. These
myths doubtless had peculiarities of their own. From one of
them may have come that remarkable statement in Gen. i. 2b,
&ldquo;and the spirit of God (Elohim) was hovering over the face of
the waters,&rdquo; which, until we find some similar myth nearer
home, is best illustrated and explained by a Polynesian myth
(see Cheyne, <i>Traditions and Beliefs of Ancient Israel</i>, ad loc.).
It is also probably to a non-Babylonian source that we owe the
prescription of vegetarian or herb diet in Gen. i. 29, 30, which
has a Zoroastrian parallel<a name="FnAnchor_26o" id="FnAnchor_26o" href="#Footnote_26o"><span class="sp">26</span></a> and is evidently based on a myth of
the Golden Age, independent of the Babylonian cosmogony.
Gen. i., therefore, has not, as it stands, been directly borrowed
from Babylonia, and yet the infused Babylonian element is so
considerable that the story is, in a purely formal aspect,
much more Babylonian than either Israelitish or Canaanitish or
N. Arabian. We say &ldquo;in a purely formal aspect,&rdquo; because the
strictness with which Babylonian mythic elements have been
adapted in Gen. i. to the wants of a virtually monotheistic
community is in the highest degree remarkable.</p>

at Rome in 1830, and claimed descent from the family of Pope
John XXIII., deposed by the council of Constance. He manifested
an independent spirit from his youth, and was expelled
from a Jesuit school on the double charge of indocility and
patriotism. After fighting for the Roman republic in 1849, he
emigrated to South America, but failing to establish himself
returned to Italy, and lived precariously as a literary man until
1870, when his reputation was established by the unexpected
success of his first acted tragedy, <i>Nero</i>. From this time to his
death in 1880 Cossa continued to produce a play a year, usually
upon some classical subject. <i>Cleopatra</i>, <i>Messalina</i>, <i>Julian</i>,
enjoyed great popularity, and his dramas on subjects derived
from Italian history, <i>Rienzi</i> and <i>The Borgias</i>, were also successful.
<i>Plautus</i>, a comedy, was preferred by the author himself, and is
more original. Cossa had neither the divination which would
have enabled him to reconstruct the ancient world, nor the
imagination which would have enabled him to idealize it. But
he was an energetic writer, never tame or languid, and at the
same time able to command the attention of an audience without
recourse to melodramatic artifice; while his sonorous verse,

<p><span class="bold">COSSACKS<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> (Russ. <i>Kazak</i>; plural, <i>Kazaki</i>, from the Turki
<i>quzz&#257;q</i>, &ldquo;adventurer, free-booter&rdquo;), the name given to considerable
portions of the population of the Russian empire, endowed
with certain special privileges, and bound in return to give
military service, all at a certain age, under special conditions.
They constitute ten separate <i>voiskos</i>, settled along the frontiers:
Don, Kuban, Terek, Astrakhan, Ural, Orenburg, Siberian,
Semiryechensk, Amur and Usuri. The primary unit of this
organization is the <i>stanitsa</i>, or village, which holds its land as
a commune, and may allow persons who are not Cossacks
(excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain
rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than
30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from
30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more
populous ones), constitutes the village assembly, similar to the
<i>mir</i>, but having wider attributes, which assesses the taxes,
divides the land, takes measures for the opening and support
of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so
on, and elects its <i>ataman</i> (elder) and its judges, who settle all
disputes up to £10 (or above that sum with the consent of both
sides). Military service is obligatory for all men, for 20 years,
beginning with the age of 18. The first 3 years are passed in
the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and
the last 5 years in the reserve. Every Cossack is bound to
procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted)&mdash;the
government supplying only the arms. Those on active service
are divided into three equal parts according to age, and the first
third only is in real service, while the two others stay at home,
but are bound to march out as soon as an order is given. The
officers are supplied in the usual way by the military schools,
in which all Cossack <i>voiskos</i> have their own vacancies, or are
non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers&rsquo; grades. In
return for this service the Cossacks have received from the
state considerable grants of land for each <i>voisko</i> separately.</p>

<p>The total Cossack population in 1893 was 2,648,049 (1,331,470
women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of
which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests.
This land was divided between the <i>stanitsas</i>, at the rate of 81
acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to
some of them, <i>in lieu</i> of pensions), and leaving about one-third
of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the
Cossack <i>voiskos</i> receive from the lands which they rent to different
persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops,
fisheries, permits of gold-digging, &amp;c.), as also from the subsidies
they receive from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), is
used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration.
They have besides a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000.
The expenditure of the village administration is covered by
village taxes. The general administration is kept separately
for each <i>voisko</i>, and differs with the different <i>voiskos</i>. The central
administration, at the Ministry of War, is composed of representatives
of each <i>voisko</i>, who discuss the proposals of all new
laws affecting the Cossacks. In time of war the ten Cossack
<i>voiskos</i> are bound to supply 890 mounted <i>sotnias</i> or squadrons
(of 125 men each), 108 infantry <i>sotnias</i> or companies (same
number), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100
men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they keep 314
squadrons, 54 infantry <i>sotnias</i>, and 20 batteries containing 108
guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, the
Cossacks have 328,705 men ready to take arms in case of need.
As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stands at a
higher level than in the remainder of Russia. They have more
schools and a greater proportion of their children go to school.
In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the
Usuri Cossacks) is sufficient to supply their needs and usually
to leave a certain surplus, they carry on extensive cattle and horse
breeding, vine culture in Caucasia, fishing on the Don, the Ural,
and the Caspian, hunting, bee-culture, &amp;c. The extraction of
coal, gold and other minerals which are found on their territories
is mostly rented to strangers, who also own most factories.</p>

<p>A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks has been
introduced into certain districts, which supply a number of
mounted infantry <i>sotnias</i>. Their peace-footing is as follows:&mdash;Daghestan,
6 regular squadrons and 3 of militia; Kuban
Circassians, 1 <i>sotnia</i>; Terek, 8 <i>sotnias</i>; Kars, 3 <i>sotnias</i>; Batum,
2 infantry and 1 mounted <i>sotnia</i>; Turkomans, 3 <i>sotnias</i>; total,
25 squadrons and 2 companies.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSSIMBAZAR,<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Kasimbazar</span>, a decayed town on the river
Bhagirathi in the Murshidabad district of Bengal, India, now
included in the Berhampur municipality. Pop. (1901) 1262.
Though the history of the place cannot be traced back earlier
than the 17th century, it was of great importance long before the
foundation of Murshidabad. From the first European traders set
up factories here, and after the ruin of Satgaon by the silting up
of the mouth of the Saraswati it gained a position, as the great
trading centre of Bengal, which was not challenged until after the
foundation of Calcutta. In 1658 the first English agent was
established at Cossimbazar, and in 1667 the chief of the factory
there became an <i>ex-officio</i> member of council. In English documents
of this period, and till the early 19th century, the Bhagirathi
was described as the Cossimbazar river, and the triangular
piece of land between the Bhagirathi, Padma and Jalangi, on
which the city stands, as the island of Cossimbazar. The
proximity of the factory to Murshidabad, the Mahommedan
capital, while it was the main source of its wealth and of its
political importance, exposed it to constant danger. Thus in
1757 it was the first to be taken by Suraj-ud-dowlah, the nawab;
ana the resident with his assistant (Warren Hastings) were taken
as prisoners to Murshidabad.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 19th century the city still flourished;
so late as 1811 it was described as famous for its silks, hosiery,
<i>koras</i> and beautiful ivory work. But an insidious change in its
once healthy climate had begun to work its decay; the area of
cultivated land round it had shrunk to vanishing point, jungle
haunted by wild beasts taking its place; and in 1813 its ruin
was completed by a sudden change in the course of the Bhagirathi,
which formed a new channel 3 m. from the old town,
leaving an evil-smelling swamp around the ancient wharves.
Of its splendid buildings the fine palace of the maharaja of
Cossimbazar alone remains, the rest being in ruins or represented
only by great mounds of earth. The first wife of Warren
Hastings was buried at Cossimbazar, where her tomb with its
inscription still remains.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSTA, GIOVANNI<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> (1826-1903), Italian painter, was born in
Rome. He fought under Garibaldi in 1848, and served as a
volunteer in the war of 1859; and his enthusiasm for Italian
unity was actively shown again in 1870, when he was the first to
mount the breach in the assault of Rome near the Porta Pia.
He had settled meanwhile at Florence, where his fight for the
independence of art from worn-out traditions was no less
strenuous, and he became known as a landscape-painter of
remarkable originality, and of great influence in the return to
minute observation of nature. He had many English friends and
followers, notably Matthew Ridley Corbet (1850-1902), and
Lord Carlisle, and was closely associated with Corot and the
Barbizon school. In later years he lived and worked mainly in
Rome, where his studio was an important centre. An exhibition
of his pictures was held in London in 1904, and he is represented
in the Tate Gallery. He died at Rome in 1903.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSTA, LORENZO<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> (1460-1535), Italian painter, was born at
Ferrara, but went in early life to Bologna and ranks with the
Bolognese school. In 1438 he painted his famous &ldquo;Madonna
and Child with the Bentivoglio family,&rdquo; and other frescoes, on
the walls of the Bentivoglio chapel in San Giacomo Maggiore, and
he followed this with many other works. He was a great friend of
Francia, who was much influenced by him. In 1509 he went to
Mantua, where his patron was the Marquis Francesco Gonzaga,
and he eventually died there. His &ldquo;Madonna and Child enthroned&rdquo;
is in the National Gallery, London, but his chief works
are at Bologna. His sons, Ippolito (1506-1561) and Girolamo,
were also painters, and so was Girolamo&rsquo;s son Lorenzo the
younger (1537-1583).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSTA, SIR MICHAEL ANDREW AGNUS<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (1808-1884),
British musical conductor and composer, the son of Cavalière
Pasquale Costa, a Spaniard, was born at Naples on the 14th of
February 1808. Here he became at an early age a scholar at the
Royal College of Music. His cantata <i>L&rsquo;Immagine</i> was composed
when he was fifteen. In 1826 he wrote his first opera <i>Il Delitto
Punito</i>; in 1827 another opera <i>Il sospetto funesto</i>. To this
period belong also his oratorio <i>La Passione</i>, a grand Mass for
four voices, a <i>Dixit Dominus</i>, and three symphonies. The opera
<i>Il Carcere d&rsquo;Ildegonda</i> was composed in 1828 for the Teatro
Nuovo, and in 1829 Costa wrote his <i>Malvina</i> for Barbaja, the
impresario of San Carlo. In this latter year he visited Birmingham
to conduct Zingarelli&rsquo;s <i>Cantata Sacra</i>, a setting of some
verses from Isaiah ch. xii. Instead, however, of conducting, he
sang the tenor part. In 1830 he settled in London, having a
connexion with the King&rsquo;s theatre. His ballet <i>Kenilworth</i> was
written in 1831, the ballet <i>Une Heure à Naples</i> in 1832, and the
ballet <i>Sir Huon</i> (composed for Taglioni) in 1833. In this latter
year he wrote his famous quartet <i>Ecco quel fiero istante.
Malek Adhel</i>, an opera, was produced in Paris in 1837. In 1842
he wrote the ballet music of <i>Alma</i> for Cerito, and in 1844 his opera
<i>Don Carlos</i> was produced in London. Costa became a naturalized
Englishman and received the honour of knighthood in 1869. He
conducted the opera at Her Majesty&rsquo;s from 1832 till 1846, when
he seceded to the Italian Opera at Covent Garden; he was
conductor of the Philharmonic Society from 1846 to 1854, of the
Sacred Harmonic Society from 1848, and of the Birmingham
festival from 1849. In 1855 Costa wrote <i>Eli</i>, and in 1864
<i>Naaman</i>, both for Birmingham. Meanwhile he had conducted
the Bradford (1853) and Handel festivals (1857-1880), and the
Leeds festivals from 1874 to 1880. On the 29th of April 1884 he
died at Brighton. Costa was the great conductor of his day, but
both his musical and his human sympathies were somewhat
limited; his compositions have passed into oblivion, with the
exception of the least admirable of them&mdash;his arrangement of the
national anthem.</p>

college; then entered the legal branch of the Turkish service,
rising to the post of <i>procureur impérial</i> at the court of cassation.
He was governor-general of Crete; and in 1895 was appointed
Ottoman ambassador in London, a post which he continued to

poet, was born at Naples about 1507. He lived in a literary
circle, and fell in love with the beautiful Vittoria Colonna. His
great work, <i>Le Istorie del regno di Napoli dal 1250 fino al 1498</i>,
first appeared at Naples in 1572, and was the fruit of thirty or
forty years&rsquo; labour; but nine more years were devoted to the
task before it was issued in its final form at Aquila (1581). It
is still one of the best histories of Naples, and the style is distinguished
by clearness, simplicity and elegance. The <i>Rime</i> of
di Costanzo are remarkable for finical taste, for polish and
frequent beauty of expression, and for strict obedience to the
poetical canons of his time.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COSTA RICA,<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> a republic of Central America, bounded on the
N. by Nicaragua, E. by the Caribbean Sea, S.E. and S. by Panama,
S.W., W. and N.W. by the Pacific Ocean. (For map, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Central
America</a></span>.) The territory thus enclosed has an area of about
18,500 sq. m., and may be roughly described as an elevated
tableland, intersected by lofty mountain ranges, with their main
axis trending from N.W. to S.E. It is fringed, along the coasts,
by low-lying marshes and lagoons, alternating with tracts of
rich soil and wastes of sand.</p>

<p><i>Physical Description.</i>&mdash;The northern frontier, drawn 2 m. S. of
the southern shores of the river San Juan and of Lake Nicaragua,
terminates at Salinas Bay on the Pacific; its southern frontier
skirts the valley of the Sixola or Tiliri, strikes south-east along the
crests of the Talamanca Mountains as far as 9° N., and then turns
sharply south, ending in Burica Point. The monotonous Atlantic
littoral is unbroken by any large inlet or estuary, and thus
contrasts in a striking manner with the varied outlines of the
Pacific coast, which includes the three bold promontories of
Nicoya, Golfo Dulce and Burica, besides the broad sweep of
Coronada Bay and several small harbours. The Gulf of Nicoya,
a shallow landlocked inlet, containing a whole archipelago of
richly-wooded islets, derives its name from Nicoya, an Indian
chief who, with his tribe, was here converted to Christianity in the
16th century. It is famous for its purple-yielding murex, pearls
and mother-of-pearl. The Golfo Dulce has an average depth of
100 fathoms and contains no islands. Two volcanic <i>Cordilleras</i>
or mountain chains, separated from one another by the central
plateau of San José and Cartago, traverse the interior of Costa
Rica, and form a single watershed, often precipitous on its
Pacific slope, but descending more gradually towards the Atlantic,
where there is a broad expanse of plain in the north-east. The
more northerly range, in which volcanic disturbances on a great
scale have been comparatively recent, extends transversely
across the country, from a point a little south of Salinas Bay,
to the headland of Carreta, the southern extremity of the Atlantic
seaboard, also known as Monkey Point. Its direction changes
from south-east to east-south-east opposite to the entrance into
the Gulf of Nicoya, where it is cut into two sections by a depression
some 20 m. wide. At first it is rather a succession of isolated
volcanic cones than a continuous ridge, the most conspicuous
peaks being Orosi (5185 ft.), the four-crested Rincon de la Vieja
(4500), Miravalles (4698) and Tenorio (6800). In this region it
is known as the Sierra de Tilaran. Then succeed the Cerros de
los Guatusos, a highland stretching for more than 50 m. without
a single volcano. Poas (8895), the scene of a violent eruption in
1834, begins a fresh series of igneous peaks, some with flooded
craters, some with a constant escape of smoke and vapour.
From Irazú (11,200), the culminating point of the range, both
oceans and the whole of Costa Rica are visible; its altitude
exceeds that of Aneto, the highest point in the Pyrenees, but so
gradual is its acclivity that the summit can easily be reached by a
man on horseback. Turialba (10,910), adjoining Irazú on the east,
was in eruption in 1866. Its name, though probably of Indian
origin, is sometimes written Turrialba, and connected with the
Latin <i>Turris Alba</i>, &ldquo;White Tower.&rdquo; The more southerly of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
the two Costa Rican ranges, known as the Cordillera de Talamanca,
rises south of the Gulf of Nicoya, and extends midway
between the two oceans towards the south-east. It follows
exactly the curve of the mainland, and is continued into Panama,
under the name of the Cordillera de Chiriqui. Its chief summits
are Chirripo Grande (11,485), the loftiest in the whole country,
Buena Vista (10,820), Ujum (8695), Pico Blanco (9645) and
Rovalo (7050), on the borders of Panama. Throughout the
volcanic area earthquakes and landslides are of frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p>The narrowness of the level ground between the mountains
and the sea renders almost impossible the formation of any
navigable river. The most important streams are those of the
Atlantic seaboard, notably the San Juan, which drains Lake
Nicaragua. Issuing from the lake within Nicaraguan territory, the
San Juan has a course of 95 m., mostly along the frontier, to the
Colorado Mouth, which is its main outfall, and belongs wholly
to Costa Rica. Its chief right-hand tributaries are the San Carlos
and Sarapiqui. The Reventazon, or Parismina, flows from the
central plateau to the Caribbean Sea; despite the shortness of
its valley, its volume is considerable, owing to the prevalence
of moist trade-winds near its sources. Six small streams and one
large river, the Rio Frio, flow across the northern frontier into
Lake Nicaragua. On the Pacific coast all the rivers are rapid
and liable to sudden floods. None is large, although three bear
the prefix <i>Rio Grande</i>, &ldquo;great river.&rdquo; The Tempisque enters
the Pacific at the head of the Gulf of Nicoya, and tends to silt
up that already shallow inlet (5-10 fathoms) with its alluvial
deposits. The Rio Grande de Tarcoles also enters the gulf, and
the Rio Grande de Pirris and Rio Grande de Terrabis or Diquis
flow into Coronada Bay. The Rio Grande de Tarcoles rises
close to the Ochomogo Pass and the sources of the Reventazon,
at the base of Irazú; and the headwaters of these two streams
indicate precisely the depression in the central plateau which
severs the northern from the southern mountains.</p>

<p>Costa Rica is not differentiated from the neighbouring lands
by any very marked peculiarities of geological formation, or of
plant and animal life. Its geology, flora and fauna are therefore
described under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Central America</a></span> (q.v.).</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;Owing to the proximity of two oceans, and the varied
configuration of the surface of Costa Rica, an area of a few square
miles may exhibit the most striking extremes of climate; but,
over the entire country, it is possible to distinguish three climatic
zones&mdash;tropical, temperate and cold. These generally succeed
one another as the altitude increases, although the heat is
greater at the same elevation on the Pacific than on the Atlantic
coast. It is, however, less oppressive, as cool breezes prevail
and damp is comparatively rare. The tropical zone comprises
the coast and the foothills, and ranges, in its mean annual
temperature, from 72° F. to 82°. In the San José plateau
(3000-5000 ft.), which is the most densely populated portion of
the temperate zone, the average is 68°, with an average variation
for all seasons of only 5°. Above 7500 ft. frosts are frequent, but
snow rarely falls. The wet season, lasting during the prevalence
of the south-west monsoon, from April to December, is clearly
defined on the Pacific slope. It is curiously interrupted by a
fortnight of dry weather, known as the <i>Veranillo de San Juan</i>,
in June. Towards the Atlantic the trade-winds may bring rain
in any month. Winter lasts from December to February.
The normal rainfall is about 80 in., but as cloud-bursts are
common, it may rise to 150 in. or even more. Rheumatism
on the Atlantic seaboard, and malaria on both coasts, are the
commonest forms of disease; but, as a whole, Costa Rica is one
of the healthiest of tropical lands.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;In 1904, according to the official returns, the
total population numbered 331,340; having increased by more
than one-fourth in a decade. Spanish, with various modifications
of dialect, and the introduction of many Indian words, is the
principal language; and the majority of the inhabitants claim
descent from the Spanish colonists&mdash;chiefly Galicians&mdash;who
came hither during the 16th and subsequent centuries. The
percentage of Spanish blood is greater than in the other Central
American republics; but there is also a large population of
half-castes (<i>ladinos</i> or <i>mestizos</i>) due to intermarriage with native
Indians. The resident foreigners, who are mostly Spaniards,
Italians, Germans and British subjects, numbered less than 8000
in 1904; immigration is, however, encouraged by the easy terms
on which land can be purchased from the state. The native
Indians, though exterminated in many districts, and civilized
in others, remain in a condition of complete savagery along parts
of the Nicaraguan border, where they are known as Prazos or
Guatusos, in the Talamanca country and elsewhere. Their
numbers may be estimated at 4000. They are a quiet and inoffensive
folk, who dwell in stockaded encampments, and preserve
their ancestral language and customs. For an account of early
Indian civilization in Costa Rica, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Central America</a></span>:
<i>Archaeology</i>. The Mosquito Indians come every summer to
fish for turtle off the Atlantic coast. As only 200 negroes were
settled in Costa Rica when slavery was abolished in 1824, and
no important increase ever took place through immigration,
the black population is remarkably small, amounting only to
some 1200.</p>

<p><i>Chief Towns and Communications.</i>&mdash;The whites are congregated
in or near the chief towns, which include the capital, San
José (pop. 1904 about 24,500), the four provincial capitals of
Alajuela (4860), Cartago (4536), Heredia (7151) and Liberia or
Guanacaste (2831), with the seaportsof Puntarenas (3569), on the
Pacific, and Limon (3171) on the Atlantic. These, with the
exception of Heredia and Liberia, are described in separate
articles. The transcontinental railway from Limon to Puntarenas
was begun in 1871, and forms the nucleus of a system intended
ultimately to connect all the fertile parts of the country, and to
join the railways of Nicaragua and Panama. It skirts the
Atlantic coast as far as the small port of Matina; thence it
passes inland to Reventazon, and bifurcates to cross the northern
mountains; one branch going north of Irazú, while the other
traverses the Ochomogo Pass. At San José these lines reunite,
and the railway is continued to Alajuela, the small Pacific port
of Tivives, and Puntarenas. The railways are owned partly by
the state, partly by the Costa Rica railway company, which, in
1904, arranged to build several branch lines through the banana
districts of the Atlantic littoral. Apart from the main lines of
communication the roads are very rough, often mere tracks;
and the principal means of transport are ox-carts or pack-mules.
The postal and telegraphic services are also somewhat inadequate.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture and Industries.</i>&mdash;The name &ldquo;Costa Rica,&rdquo; meaning
&ldquo;rich coast,&rdquo; is well deserved; for, owing to the combination of
ample sunshine and moisture with a wonderfully fertile soil,
almost any kind of fruit or flower can be successfully cultivated;
while the vast tracts of virgin forest, which remain along the
Atlantic slopes, contain an abundance of cedar, mahogany,
rosewood, rubber and ebony, with fustic and other precious
dye-woods. The country is essentially agricultural, and owes its
political stability to the presence of a large class of peasant proprietors,
who number more than two-thirds of the population.
Coffee, first planted in 1838, is grown chiefly on the plateau of
San José. The special adaptability of this region to its growth is
attributed to the nature of the soil, which consists of layers of
black or dark-brown volcanic ash, varying in depth from 1 to
6 yds. Bananas are grown over a large and increasing area;
rice, maize, barley, potatoes and beans are cultivated to some
extent in the interior; cocoa, vanilla, sugar-cane, cotton and
indigo are products of the warm coast-lands, but are hardly
raised in sufficient quantities to meet the local demand. Stock-farming,
a relatively undeveloped industry, tends to become
more important, owing to the assistance which the state renders
by the importation of horses, cattle, sheep and swine, from
Europe and the United States, in order to improve the native
breeds. In the south-east farmers are often compelled to retire
with their flocks and herds before the thousands of huge,
migratory vampires, which descend suddenly on the pastures and
are able in one night to bleed the strongest animal to death.
The manufactures are insignificant; and although silver, copper,
iron, zinc, lead and marble are said to exist in considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
quantities, the only ores that have been worked are gold, silver
and copper. At the beginning of the 20th century the silver and
copper mines had been abandoned. The goldfields are exploited
with American capital, and yield a fair return.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;The exports, which comprise coffee, bananas,
cocoa, cabinet-woods and dye-woods, with hides and skins,
mother-of-pearl, tortoiseshell and gold, were officially valued at
£1,398,000 in 1904; and in the same year the imports, including
foodstuffs, dry goods and hardware, were valued at £1,229,000.
Over £1,250,000 worth of the exports consisted of coffee and
bananas, and these commodities were of almost equal value.
Nearly 85% of the coffee, or more than 20,000,000 &#8468;, were sent
to Great Britain. The development of the banana trade dates
from 1881, when 3500 bunches of fruit were exported to New
Orleans. This total increased very rapidly, and in 1902 a
monthly service of steamers was established from Limon to
Bristol and Manchester. The service to England soon became a
weekly one, while there are at least three weekly sailings to the
United States. In 1904 the number of bunches sent abroad
exceeded 6,000,000. So important is this crop that the rate of
wages to labourers in the banana districts is nearly 3s. daily,
as compared with an average of 1s. 8d. in the coffee plantations.
The bulk of the imports comes from the United States (52% in
1904), Great Britain (19%) and Germany (13%). Almost the
whole foreign trade passes through Limon and Puntarenas. In
1904, exclusive of banana steamers, there were regular steamship
services weekly from Limon to the United States and Germany,
fortnightly to Great Britain, and monthly to France, Italy and
Spain; while at Puntarenas four American liners called monthly
on the voyage between San Francisco and Panama.</p>

<p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;The valuable resources of the republic, and its
comparative immunity from revolution, formerly attracted the
attention of European and American investors, who supplied
the capital for internal development. In 1871 the government
contracted a loan of £1,000,000 in London, and in 1872 it borrowed
an additional £2,400,000 for railway construction. The outstanding
foreign debt amounted in 1887 to £2,691,300, while the
arrears of interest were no less than £2,119,500. An arrangement
with the creditors was concluded in 1888; but in 1895 the
republic again became bankrupt, and a fresh arrangement was
sanctioned in March 1897, by which the interest on £1,475,000
was reduced to 2½% and that on £525,000 to 3%. It was provided
that amortization, at £10,000 yearly, should begin in 1917.
In 1904 the service of the external debt, which then amounted to
£2,500,000, including £500,000 arrears of interest, was again
suspended; the total of the internal debt was £815,000. About
one-half of the national revenue is derived from customs, the
remainder being principally furnished by railways, stamps, and
the salt and tobacco monopolies. In the financial year 1904-1905
the revenue was £503,000, the expenditure £390,000.
Education, internal development and the service of the internal
debt were the chief sources of expenditure.</p>

<p><i>Money and Credit.</i>&mdash;There are three important banks, the
Anglo-Costa Rican Bank, with a capital of £120,000, the Bank of
Costa Rica (£200,000), and the Commercial Bank of Costa Rica
(£100,000), founded in 1905. On the 25th of April 1900 a law
was enacted for the regulation of the constitution, capital, note
emission and metallic reserves of banks. On the 24th of October
1896 an act was passed for the adoption of a gold coinage, and the
execution of this act was decreed on the 17th of April 1900.
The monetary unit is the gold colon weighing .778 gramme,
.900 fine, and thus worth about 23d. It is legally equivalent to
the silver peso, which continues in circulation. The gold coins
of the United States, Great Britain, France and Germany are
legally current. The metric system of weights and measures was
introduced by law in 1884, but the old Spanish system is still
in use.</p>

<p><i>Constitution and Government.</i>&mdash;Costa Rica is governed under a
constitution of 1870, which, however, only came into force in 1882,
and has often been modified. The legislative power resides in
a House of Representatives, consisting of about 30 to 40 deputies,
or one for every 8000 inhabitants. The deputies are chosen for a
term of four years by local electoral colleges, whose members are
returned by the votes of all self-supporting citizens. One-half
of the chamber retires automatically every two years. The
president and three vice-presidents constitute the executive.
They are assisted by a cabinet of four ministers, representing the
departments of the interior, police and public works; foreign
affairs, justice, religion and education; finance and commerce;
war and marine. For purposes of local administration the state
is divided into five provinces, Alajuela, Cartago, Guanacaste,
Heredia and San José, and two maritime districts (<i>comarcas</i>),
Limon and Puntarenas. All these divisions except Guanacaste&mdash;which
takes its name from a variety of mimosa very common in
the province&mdash;are synonymous with their chief towns; and each
is controlled by a governor or prefect appointed by the president.
Justice is administered by a supreme court, two courts of appeal,
and the court of cassation, which sit in San José, and are supplemented
by various inferior tribunals.</p>

<p><i>Religion and Education.</i>&mdash;The Roman Catholic Church is
supported by the state, and the vast majority of the people
accept its doctrines; but complete religious liberty is guaranteed
by the constitution. The Jesuits, who formerly exercised widespread
influence, were expelled in 1884. Of the other religious
communities, the most important are the Protestants, numbering
3000, and the Buddhists, about 250. Primary education is free
and compulsory; the standard of attendance is high and the
instruction fair, but a large proportion of the older inhabitants
were illiterate at the beginning of the 20th century. In the
matter of secondary education considerable neglect has been
shown. In 1904 there were only six secondary schools, including
the institute of law and medicine and the training-school for
teachers at San José. The state grants scholarships tenable
at European universities to promising pupils, and there are
three important public libraries.</p>

<p><i>Defence.</i>&mdash;Military service in time of war is compulsory for all
able-bodied citizens aged 18-50. There are a permanent army,
of about 600; a militia, comprising an active service branch
to which all under 40 belong, with a reserve for those between
40 and 50; and a national guard, including all males under
18 and over 50 who are capable of bearing arms. On a war
footing these forces would number about 36,000. A gunboat
and a torpedo boat constitute the navy, which, however, requires
the services of an admiral, subordinate to the ministry of marine.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The origin of the name <i>Costa Rica</i> (Spanish for
&ldquo;Rich Coast&rdquo;) has been much disputed. It is often stated
that the territories to which the name is now applied were first
known as <i>Nueva Cartago</i>, while <i>Costa Rica</i> was used in a wider
sense to designate the whole south-western coast of the Caribbean
Sea, from the supposed mineral wealth of this region. Then, in
1540, the name was restricted to an area approximately equal
to that of modern Costa Rica. In such a case it must have been
bestowed ironically, for the country proved very unprofitable
to the gold-seekers, who were its earliest European settlers.
Col. Church, in the paper cited below, derives it from <i>Costa de
Oreja</i>, &ldquo;Earring Coast,&rdquo; in allusion to the earrings worn by the
Indians and remarked by their conquerors. He quotes evidence
to show that this name was known to 16th-century cartographers.</p>

<p>With the rest of Central America, Costa Rica remained a
province of the Spanish captaincy-general of Guatemala until
1821. Its conquest was completed by 1530, and ten years later
it was made a separate province, the limits of which were fixed,
by order of Philip II., between 1560 and 1573. This task was
principally executed by Juan Vazquez de Coronado (or Vasquez
de Coronada), an able and humane governor appointed in 1562,
whose civilizing work was undone by the almost uninterrupted
maladministration of his fifty-eight successors. The Indians
were enslaved, and their welfare was wholly subordinated to
the quest for gold. From 1666 onwards both coasts were ravaged
by pirates, who completed the ruin of the country. Diego de
la Haya y Fernandez, governor in 1718, reported to the crown
that no province of Spanish America was in so wretched a condition.
Cocoa-beans were the current coinage. Tomás de Acosta,
governor from 1797 to 1809, confirmed this report, and stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
that the Indians were clothed in bark, and compelled in many
cases to borrow even this primitive attire when the law required
their attendance at church.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September 1821 Costa Rica, with the other
Central American provinces, revolted and joined the Mexican
empire under the dynasty of Iturbide; but this subjection never
became popular, and, on the establishment of a Mexican republic
in 1823, hostilities broke out between the Conservatives, who
desired to maintain the union, and the Liberals, who wished to
set up an independent republic. The opposing factions met
near the Ochomogo Pass; the republicans were victorious, and
the seat of government was transferred from Cartago, the old
capital, to San José, the Liberal headquarters. From 1824 to
1839 Costa Rica joined the newly formed Republic of the United
States of Central America; but the authority of the central
government proved little more than nominal, and the Costa
Ricans busied themselves with trade and abstained from politics.
The exact political status of the country was not, however,
definitely assured until 1848, when an independent republic was
again proclaimed. In 1856-60 the state was involved in war
with the adventurer William Walker (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Central America</a></span>);
but its subsequent history has been one of immunity from
political disturbances, other than boundary disputes, and
occasional threats of revolution, due chiefly to unsatisfactory
economic conditions. The attempt of J. R. Barrios, president
of Guatemala, to restore federal unity to Central America failed
in 1885, and had little influence on Costa Rican affairs. In 1897
the state joined the Greater Republic of Central America, established
in 1895 by Honduras, Nicaragua and Salvador, but
dissolved in 1898. The boundary question between Costa Rica
and Nicaragua was referred to the arbitration of the president
of the United States, who gave his award in 1888, confirming
a treaty of 1858; further difficulties arising from the work of
demarcation were settled by treaty in 1896. The boundary
between Costa Rica and Panama (then a province of Colombia)
was fixed by the arbitration of the French president, who gave
his award on the 15th of September 1900. The frontiers delimited
in accordance with these awards have already been
described.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSTELLO, DUDLEY<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (1803-1865), English journalist and
novelist, son of Colonel J. F. Costello, was born in Ireland in
1803. He was educated for the army at Sandhurst, and served
for a short time in India, Canada and the West Indies. His
literary and artistic tastes led him to quit the army in 1828,
and he then passed some years in Paris. He was introduced to
Baron Cuvier, who employed him as draughtsman in the preparation
of his <i>Règne animal</i>. He next occupied himself in
copying illuminated manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Royale;
and to him and his sister belongs the merit of being the first to
draw general attention to this beautiful forgotten art, and of
thus leading to its revival. About 1838 Costello became foreign
correspondent to the <i>Morning Herald</i>; in 1846 he became foreign
correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>; and during the last twenty
years of his life he held the post of sub-editor of the <i>Examiner</i>.
He wrote <i>A Tour through the Valley of the Meuse</i> (1845) and
<i>Piedmont and Italy, from the Alps to the Tiber</i> (1859-1861).
Among his novels are <i>Stories from a Screen</i> (1855), <i>The Millionaire</i>
(1858), <i>Faint Heart never won Fair Lady</i> (1859) and <i>Holidays
with Hobgoblins</i> (1860). He died on the 30th of September 1865.</p>

<p>His elder sister, <span class="sc">Louisa Stuart Costello</span> (1799-1870), author
and miniature painter, was born in Ireland in 1799. Her father
died while she was young, and Louisa, who removed to Paris
with her mother in 1814, helped to support her mother and
brother by her skill as an artist. At the age of sixteen she
published a volume of verse entitled <i>The Maid of the Cyprus Isle,
and other poems</i>. This was followed in 1825 by <i>Songs of a Stranger</i>,
dedicated to W. L. Bowles. Ten years later appeared her
<i>Specimens of the Early Poetry of France</i>, illustrated by beautifully
executed illuminations, the work of her brother and herself. It
was dedicated to Moore, and procured her his friendship as well
as that of Sir Walter Scott. Her principal works are&mdash;<i>A Summer
among the Bocages and Vines</i> (1840); <i>The Queen&rsquo;s Poisoner</i> (or
<i>The Queen-Mother</i>), a historical romance (1841); <i>Béarn and
the Pyrenees</i> (1844); <i>Memoirs of Eminent Englishwomen</i> (1844);
<i>The Rose Garden of Persia</i> (1845), a series of translations from
Persian poets, with illuminations by herself and her brother;
<i>The Falls, Lakes and Mountains of North Wales</i> (1845); <i>Clara
Fane</i> (1848), a novel; <i>Memoirs of Mary of Burgundy</i> (1853);
and <i>Memoirs of Anne of Brittany</i> (1855). She died at Boulogne
on the 24th of April 1870.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COSTER-MONGER<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> (originally <span class="sc">Costard-monger</span>, a seller of
costards, a species of large ribbed apple). The word &ldquo;monger&rdquo;
is common, in various forms, in Teutonic languages in the sense
of trader or dealer, and appears in &ldquo;iron-monger&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-monger,&rdquo;
and with a derogatory significance of petty or under-hand
dealing in such words as &ldquo;scandal-monger.&rdquo; A &ldquo;coster-monger,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;coster,&rdquo; originally, therefore, one who sold apples
and fruit in the street, is now an itinerant dealer in fruit,
vegetables or fish, but more particularly, as distinguished from a
&ldquo;hawker&rdquo; on the one hand, and &ldquo;general dealer&rdquo; on the other,
is a street trader in the above commodities who uses a barrow.
The coster-monger&rsquo;s trade in London, so far as it falls under
clause 6 of the Metropolitan Streets Act 1867, which deals with
obstruction by goods to footways and streets is subject to regulations
of the commissioner of police. So long as these are carried
out, coster-mongers, street hawkers and itinerant traders are
exempted, by an amending act, from the liabilities imposed
by clause 6 of the above act.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COSTS,<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> a term used in English law to denote the expenses
incurred (1) in employing a lawyer in his professional capacity
for purposes other than litigation; (2) in instituting and carrying
on litigation whether with or without the aid of a lawyer.</p>

<p><i>Solicitor and Client.</i>&mdash;The retainer of a solicitor implies a
contract to pay to him his proper charges and disbursements
with respect to the work done by him as a solicitor. In cases of
conveyancing his remuneration is now for the most part regulated
by scales <i>ad valorem</i> on the value of the property dealt with
(Solicitors&rsquo; Remuneration Order 1882), and clients are free to
make written agreements for the conduct of any class of non-litigious
business, fixing the costs by a percentage on the value of
the amount involved. So far as litigious business is concerned,
the arrangement known as &ldquo;no cure no pay&rdquo; is objected to by
the courts and the profession as leading to speculative actions, and
stipulations as to a share of the proceeds of a successful action are
champertous and illegal. An English solicitor&rsquo;s bill drawn in
the old form is a voluminous itemized narrative of every act done
by him in the cause or matter with a charge set against each
entry and often against each letter written. Before the solicitor
can recover from his client the amount of his charges, he must
deliver a signed bill of costs and wait a month before suing.</p>

<p>The High Court has a threefold jurisdiction to deal with
solicitors&rsquo; costs:&mdash;(1) by virtue of its jurisdiction over them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
as its officers; (2) statutory, under the Solicitors Act 1843
and other legislation; (3) ordinary, to ascertain the reasonableness
of charges made the subject of a claim.</p>

<p>The client can, as a matter of course, get an order for taxation
within a month of the delivery of the solicitor&rsquo;s bill, and either
client or solicitor can get such an order as of course within twelve
months of delivery. After expiry of that time the court may order
taxation if the special circumstances call for it, and even so late
as twelve months after actual payment.</p>

<p>Costs as between solicitor and client are taxed in the same
office as litigious costs, and objections to the decisions of the
taxing officer, if properly made, can be taken for review to a judge
of the High Court and to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p><i>Litigious Costs.</i>&mdash;The expenses of litigation fall in the first
instance on the person who undertakes the proceedings or retains
and employs the lawyer. It is in accordance with the ordinary
ideas of justice that the expenses of the successful party to litigation
should be defrayed by the unsuccessful party, a notion expressed
in the phrase that &ldquo;costs follow the event.&rdquo; But there
are many special circumstances which interfere to modify the
application of this rule. The action, though successful, may be
in its nature frivolous or vexatious, or it may have been brought
in a higher court where a lower court would have been competent
to deal with it. On the other hand the defendant, although he
has escaped a judgment against him, may by his conduct have
rendered the action necessary or otherwise justifiable. In such
cases the rule that costs should follow the event would be felt
to work an injustice, and exceptions to its operation have
therefore been devised. In the law of England the provisions as to
litigious costs, though now simpler than of old, are still elaborate
and complicated, and the costs themselves are on a higher scale
than is known in most other countries.</p>

<p>Except as regards appeals to the House of Lords and suits
in equity, the right to recover costs from the opposite party in
litigation has always depended on statute law or on rules made
under statutory authority, &ldquo;Costs are the creature of statute.&rdquo;
The House of Lords has declared its competence to grant costs
on appeals independently of statute.</p>

<p>In the judicial committee of the privy council the power to
award, in its discretion, costs on appeals from the colonies or
other matters referred to it, is given by § 15 of the Judicial
Committee Act 1833; and the costs are taxed by the registrar
of the council.</p>

<p>Courts of equity have always claimed a discretion independently
of statute to give or refuse costs, but as a general rule the maxim
of the civil law, <i>victus victori in expensis condemnatus est</i>, was
followed. The successful party was recognized to have a prima
facie claim to costs, but the court might, on sufficient cause
shown, not only deprive him of his costs, but even in some rare
cases order him to pay the costs of his unsuccessful opponent.
There was a class of cases in which the court generally gave costs
to parties sustaining a certain character, whatever might be the
result of the suit (e.g. trustees, executors and mortgagees).</p>

<p>In the courts of common law, costs were not given either to
plaintiff or defendant, although the damages given to a successful
plaintiff might suffice to cover not only the loss sustained by the
wrong done, but also the expense he had been put to in taking
proceedings. The defendant in a baseless or vexatious action
could not even recover his costs thus indirectly, and the indirect
costs given to a plaintiff under the name of damages were often
inadequate and uncertain. Costs were first given under the
Statute of Gloucester (1277, 6 Edward I. c. 1), which enacted
that &ldquo;the demandant shall recover damages in an assize of novel
disseisin and in writs of mort d&rsquo;ancestor, cosinage, aiel and beziel,
and further that the demandant may recover against the tenant
the costs of his writ purchased together with the damages above
said. And this act shall hold in all cases when the party is to
recover damages.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;costs of his writ&rdquo; were extended
to mean all the legal costs in the suit. The statute gave costs,
wherever damages were recovered, and no matter what the
amount of the damages may be. Costs were first given to a
defendant by the Statute of Marlbridge (1267) in a case relating
to wardship in chivalry (52 Henry III. C. 6); but costs were not
given generally to successful defendants until 1531 (23 Henry VIII.
c. 15), when it was enacted that &ldquo;if in the actions therein mentioned
the plaintiff after appearance of the defendant be non-suited,
or any verdict happen to pass by lawful trial against the
plaintiff, the defendant shall have judgment to recover his costs
against the plaintiff, to be assessed and taxed at the discretion of
the court, and shall have such process and execution for the
recovery and paying his costs against the plaintiff, as the plaintiff
should or might have had against the defendant, in case the judgment
had been given for the plaintiff.&rdquo; In 1606 by 4 James I. c. 3,
this &ldquo;good and profitable law&rdquo; was extended to other actions
not originally specified, although within the mischief of the act,
so that in any action wherein the plaintiff might have costs if
judgment were given for him, the defendant if successful should
have costs against the plaintiff. The policy of these enactments
is expressed to be the discouragement of frivolous and unjust
suits. This policy was carried out by other and later acts.
The Limitations Act 1623, § 6, ordered that if the plaintiff in an
action of slander recovered less than 40s. damages, the plaintiff
should be allowed no more as costs than he got as damages.
By 43 Elizabeth c. 6 it was enacted that in any personal action not
being for any title or interest in land, nor concerning the freehold
or inheritance of lands nor for battery, where the damages
did not amount to 40s. no more costs than damages could be
allowed. By 3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 24 (Lord Denman&rsquo;s Act 1840),
where the plaintiff in an action of tort recovered less than 40s.,
he was not allowed costs unless the judge certified that the action
was really brought to try a right besides the right to recover
damages, or that the injury was wilful or malicious.</p>

<p>All these enactments have been superseded by the Judicature
Acts, but in the case of slander on women the provisions of the
act of 1623 were re-enacted in the Slander of Women Act 1891.</p>

<p><i>Supreme Court.</i>&mdash;The general rule now in force in the Supreme
Court of Judicature is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Subject to the provisions
of the Judicature Acts and the rules of the court made thereunder,
and to the express provision of any statute whether passed before
or after the 14th of August 1890, the costs of and incident to all
proceedings in the Supreme Court, including the administration
of estates and trusts, shall be in the discretion of the court or
judge, and the court or judge shall have full power to determine
by whom and to what extent such costs are to be paid. Provided
(1) that nothing herein contained shall deprive an executor,
administrator, trustee or mortgagee who has not unreasonably
carried on or resisted any proceedings of any right to costs out
of a particular estate or fund to which he would be entitled
under the rules hitherto (i.e. before 1883) acted upon in the
chancery division as successor of the court of chancery; (2)
that where an action, cause, matter or issue is tried with a jury,
the costs shall follow the event unless the judge who tried the case
or the court shall for good cause otherwise order.&rdquo; (R.S.C., O.
65, r. 1.)</p>

<p>The rule above stated applies to civil proceedings on the
crown side of the king&rsquo;s bench division, including mandamus,
prohibition <i>quo warranto</i>, and certiorari (<i>R.</i> v. <i>Woodhouse</i>, 1906,
2 K.B. 502, 540); and to proceedings on the revenue side of that
division (O. 68, r. 1); but it does not apply to criminal proceedings
in the High Court, which are regulated by the crown office rules of
1906, or by statutes dealing with particular breaches of the law,
and as to procedure in taxing costs by O. 65, r. 27, of the Rules
of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The rule is also subject to specific provision empowering the
courts to limit the costs to be adjudged against the unsuccessful
party in proceedings in the High Court, which could and should
have been instituted in a county court, e.g. actions of contract
under £100, or actions of tort in which less than £10 is recovered
(County Courts Act 1888, §§ 65, 66, 116; County Courts Act
1903, § 3).</p>

<p>For instance, in actions falling within the Public Authorities
Protection Act 1893 against public bodies or officials, the
defendant, if successful, is entitled to recover costs as between
solicitor and client unless a special order to the contrary is made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
by the court; and under some statutes still unrepealed, double
or treble costs are to be allowed. Besides the rules above stated,
there is also a provision, adopted from the practice of courts of
equity, that if tender was made before action of a sum sufficient to
satisfy the plaintiff&rsquo;s just demand and is followed by payment
into court in the action of the sum tendered, the court will make
the plaintiff pay the costs of action as having been unnecessarily
brought.</p>

<p>Costs of interlocutory proceedings in the course of a litigation
are sometimes said to be &ldquo;costs in the cause,&rdquo; that is, they abide
the result of the principal issue. A party succeeding in interlocutory
proceedings, and paying the costs therein made &ldquo;costs
in the cause,&rdquo; would recover the amount of such costs if he had
a judgment for costs on the result of the whole trial, but not
otherwise. But it is usual now not to tax the costs of interlocutory
proceedings till after final judgment.</p>

<p><i>Taxation.</i>&mdash;When an order to pay the costs of litigation is made
the costs are taxed in the central office of the High Court,
unless the court when making the order fixes the amount to be
paid (R.S.C., O. 65, r. 23). Recent changes in the organization for
taxing have tended to create a uniformity of system and method
which had long been needed.</p>

<p>The taxation is effected, under an elaborate set of regulations,
by reference to the prescribed scales, and on what is known as the
lower scale, unless the court has specially ordered taxation on the
higher scale (R.S.C., O. 65, rr. 8, 9, appendix N).</p>

<p>In the taxation of litigious costs two methods are still adopted,
known as &ldquo;between party and party&rdquo; and &ldquo;between solicitor
and client.&rdquo; Unless a special order is made the first of the two
methods is adopted. Until very recently &ldquo;party and party&rdquo;
costs were found to be a very imperfect indemnity to the successful
litigant; because many items which his solicitor would be
entitled to charge against him for the purposes of the litigation
were not recoverable from his unsuccessful opponent. The High
Court can now, in exercise of the equitable jurisdiction derived
from the court of chancery, make orders on the losing party to
pay the costs of the winner as between solicitor and client.
These orders are not often made except in the chancery division.
But even where party and party costs only are ordered to be paid
under the present practice (dating from 1902), the taxing office
allows against the unsuccessful party all costs, charges and
expenses necessary or proper for the attainment of justice or
defending the rights of the successful party, but not costs incurred
through over-caution, negligence, or by paying special fees to
counsel or special fees to witnesses or other persons, or by any
other unusual expenses (R.S.C., O. 65, rr. 27, 29). This practice
tends to give an approximate indemnity, while preventing
oppression of the losing party by making him pay for lavish
expenditure by his opponent. The taxation is subject to review
by a judge on formal objections carried on, and an appeal lies to
the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p><i>County Courts.</i>&mdash;The costs of all proceedings in county courts
follow the event, unless the judge in his discretion otherwise
orders. The amount allowed is regulated by scales included in
the county court rules, and is ascertained by the registrar of the
court subject to any special direction by the judge, and to review
by him. The costs are allowed as between party and party, but
the registrar on the application of solicitor or party, and subject
to the like review, taxes costs as between solicitor and client.
Nothing is allowed which is not sanctioned by the scales, unless it
is proved that the client has agreed in writing to pay (County
Courts Act 1888, § 118).</p>

<p><i>Costs in Criminal Cases.</i>&mdash;In criminal cases the right to recover
the expenses of prosecution or defence from public funds or the
opposite party depends wholly on statute. According to the
common law rule the crown neither pays nor receives costs, but
the rule is in some cases altered by statute (<i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Pritchard</i>,
1903, 1 K.B. 209).</p>

<p>Courts of summary jurisdiction may order costs to be paid by
the unsuccessful to the successful party (Summary Jurisdiction
Act 1848, § 18).</p>

<p>On prosecutions for treason or felony the court may order the
accused person, if convicted, to pay the costs of his prosecution
(Forfeiture Act 1870); and the like power exists as to persons
convicted of offences indictable under the Criminal Law Amendment
Act 1885 (see § 18), and as to persons convicted on indictment
of assault, corrupt practices at elections, offences against
the Merchandise Marks Acts, or of defamatory libel, if they have
unsuccessfully pleaded jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for the payment out of the local rate of
the district of the costs of prosecuting all felonies (except treason
felony) and a number of misdemeanours. A list of these offences
will be found in Archbold, <i>Criminal Pleading</i>, 23rd ed., 246.
The legislation on this subject authorizes the payment of the
expenses of witnesses and of the prosecutor, both at a preliminary
inquiry before justices and at the trial, and in the case of
summary conviction for any of the indictable offences in question.
It has been extended so as to include the expenses of witnesses for
the defence in any indictable case if they have given evidence at
the preliminary inquiry, and the costs of the defence of poor
prisoners in every indictable case in which the committing
justices or the court of trial certify for legal aid (Poor Prisoners&rsquo;
Defence Act 1903). The costs are taxed by the proper officer of
the court of assize or the clerk of the peace in accordance with
scales issued by the Home Office in 1903 and 1904. These scales
do not fix the fees to be allowed to counsel or solicitor for the
prosecution. The costs, when taxed, are paid by the treasurer of
the county or borough on whom the order for payment is made.</p>

<p>Where a prosecution or indictment fails, the prosecutor
cannot as a rule be made to pay the costs of the defence: except
in cases within the Vexatious Indictments Act 1859 and its
amendments (i.e. where he has, after a refusal by justices to
commit for trial, insisted on continuing the prosecution); or
where a defamatory libel is successfully justified, or where
prosecutions in respect of merchandise marks or corrupt practices
at elections have failed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COSTUME<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (through the Fr. <i>costume</i>, from Ital. <i>costume</i>, Late
Lat. <i>costuma</i>, a contracted form of Lat. <i>consuetudinem</i>, acc. of
<i>consuetudo</i>, custom, habit, manner, &amp;c.), dress or clothing,
especially the distinctive clothing worn at different periods by
different peoples or different classes of people. The word appears
in English in the 18th century, and was first applied to the
correct representation, in literature and art, of the manners,
dress, furniture and general surroundings of the scene represented.
By the early part of the 19th century it became restricted
to the fashion or style of personal apparel, including the head-dresses,
jewelry and the like.</p>

<p>The subject of clothing is far wider than appears at first sight.
To the average man there is a distinction between clothing and
ornament, the first being regarded as that covering which satisfies
the claims of modesty, the second as those appendages which
satisfy the aesthetic sense. This distinction, however, does not
exist for science, and indeed the first definition involves a fallacy
of which it will be as well to dispose forthwith.</p>

<p>Modesty is not innate in man, and its conventional nature is
easily seen from a consideration of the different ideas held by
different races on this subject. With Mahommedan peoples
it is sufficient for a woman to cover her face; the Chinese women
would think it extremely indecent to show their artificially
compressed feet, and it is even improper to mention them to a
woman; in Sumatra and Celebes the wild tribes consider the
exposure of the knee immodest; in central Asia the finger-tips,
and in Samoa the navel are similarly regarded. In Tahiti and
Tonga clothing might be discarded without offence, provided
the individual were tattooed; and among the Caribs a woman
might leave the hut without her girdle but not unpainted.
Similarly, in Alaska, women felt great shame when seen without
the plugs they carried in their lips. Europeans are considered
indelicate in many ways by other races, and a remark of Peschel<a name="FnAnchor_1p" id="FnAnchor_1p" href="#Footnote_1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
is to the point: &ldquo;Were a pious Mussulman of Ferghana to be
present at our balls and see the bare shoulders of our wives and
daughters, and the semi-embraces of our round dances, he would
silently wonder at the long-suffering of Allah who had not long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
ago poured fire and brimstone on this sinful and shameless
generation.&rdquo; Another point of interest lies in the difference of
outlook with which nudity is regarded by the English and
Japanese. Among the latter it has been common for the sexes
to take baths together without clothing, while in England mixed
bathing, even in full costume, is even now by no means universal.
Yet in England the representation of the nude in art meets
with no reproach, though considered improper by the Japanese.
Even more striking is the fact that in civilized countries what
is permitted at certain times is forbidden at others; a woman
will expose far more of her person at night, in the ballroom or
theatre, than would be considered seemly by day in the street;
and a bathing costume which would be thought modest on the
beach would meet with reprobation in a town.</p>

<p>Modesty therefore is highly conventional, and to discover its
origin the most primitive tribes must be observed. Among these,
in Africa, South America, Australia and so forth, where clothing
is at a minimum, the men are always more elaborately ornamented
than the women. At the same time it is noticeable that
no cases of spinsterhood are found; celibacy, rare as it is, is
confined to the male sex. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude
that ornament is a stimulus to sexual selection, and this conclusion
is enforced by the fact that among many comparatively
nude peoples clothing is assumed at certain dances which have
as their confessed object the excitation of the passions of the
opposite sex. Many forms of clothing, moreover, seem to call
attention to those parts of the body of which, under the conditions
of Western civilization at the present day, it aims at the concealment;
certain articles of dress worn by the New Hebrideans,
the Zulu-Xosa tribes, certain tribes of Brazil and others, are
cases in point. Clothing, moreover&mdash;and this is true also of the
present day&mdash;almost always tends to accentuate rather than to
conceal the difference between the sexes. Looking at the question
then from the point of view of sexual selection it would seem
that a stage in the progress of human society is marked by the
discovery that concealment affords a greater stimulus than
revelation; that the fact is true is obvious,&mdash;even to modern
eyes a figure partially clad appears far more indecent than a
nude. That the stimulus is real is seen in the fact that among
nude races flagrant immorality is far less common than among
the more clothed; the contrast between the Polynesians and
Melanesians, living as neighbours under similar conditions, is
striking evidence on this point. Later, when the novelty of
clothing has spent its force, the stimulus is supplied by nudity
complete or partial.</p>

<p>One more point must be considered: there is the evidence
of competent observers to show that members of a tribe accustomed
to nudity, when made to assume clothing for the first
time, exhibit as much confusion as would a European compelled
to strip in public. This fact, considered together with what
has been said above, compels the conclusion that modesty is a
feeling merely of acute self-consciousness due to appearing
unusual, and is the result of clothing rather than the cause. In
the words of Westermarck: &ldquo;The facts appear to prove that the
feeling of shame, far from being the cause of man&rsquo;s covering his
body, is, on the contrary, a result of this custom; and that the
covering, if not used as a protection from the climate, owes its
origin, at least in a great many cases, to the desire of men and
women to make themselves mutually attractive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Primitive adornment in its earliest stages may be divided
into three classes; first the moulding of the body itself to certain
local standards of beauty. In this category may be placed
head-deformation, which reached its extreme development
among the Indians of North-West America and the ancient
Peruvians; foot-constriction as practised by the Chinese;
tooth-chipping among many African tribes; and waist-compression
common in Europe at the present day. Many forms of
deformation, it may be remarked in passing, emphasize some
natural physical characteristic of the people who practise them.
Secondly, the application of extraneous matter to the body, as
painting and tattooing, and the raising of ornamental scars
often by the introduction of foreign matter into flesh-wounds
(this practice belongs partly to the first category also). Thirdly,
the suspension of foreign bodies from, or their attachment to,
convenient portions of the body. This category, by far the
largest, includes ear-, nose- and lip-ornaments, head-dresses,
necklets, armlets, wristlets, leglets, anklets, finger-and toe-rings
and girdles. The last are important, as it is from the waist-ornaments
chiefly that what is commonly considered clothing
at the present day has been developed.</p>

<p>Setting aside for the moment the less important, historically,
of these, nearly all of which exist in Western civilization of the
present day, it will be as well to consider that form of dress which
is marked by the greatest evolution. It is generally supposed
that man originated in tropical or subtropical latitudes, and
spread gradually towards the poles. Naturally, as the temperature
became lower, a new function was gradually acquired by
his clothing, that of protecting the body of the wearer. Climate
then is one of the forces which play an important part in the
evolution of dress; at the same time care must be taken not to
attribute too much influence to it. It must be remembered that
the Arabs, who inhabit an extremely hot country, are very fully
clothed, while the Fuegians at the extremity of Cape Horn,
exposed to all the rigours of an antarctic climate, have, as sole
protection, a skin attached to the body by cords, so that it can
be shifted to either side according to the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>Dr. C. H. Stratz divides clothing climatically into two classes:
tropical, which is based on the girdle (or, when the attachment
is fastened round the neck, the cloak), and the arctic, based on the
trouser. This classification is ingenious and convenient as far
as it goes, but it seems probable that the trouser, which also has
the waist as its point of attachment, may itself be a further
development of the girdle. Certainly, however, in historical
times the division holds good, and it is worthy of remark that one
of the points about the northern barbarians which struck the
ancient Greeks and Romans most forcibly was the fact that they
wore trousers. Amongst the most northerly races the latter
garb is worn by both sexes alike; farther south by the men, the
women retaining the tropical form; farther south still the latter
reigns supreme. No distinct latitude can be assigned as a
boundary between the two forms, from the simple fact that
where migration in comparatively recent times has taken place
a natural conservatism has prevented the more familiar garb
from being discarded; at the same time the two forms can often
be seen within the limits of the same country; as, for instance,
in China, where the women of Shanghai commonly wear trousers,
those of Hong-Kong skirts. The retention by women in Europe
of the tropical garb can be explained by the fact that her sphere
has been mainly confined to the house, and her life has been less
active than that of man; consequently the adoption of the
arctic dress has been in her case less necessary. But it is noticeable
that where women engage in occupations of a more than
usually strenuous nature, they frequently don male costume
while at their work; as, for instance, women who work in mines
(Belgium) and who tend cattle (Switzerland, Tirol). The
retention of the tropical pattern by the Highlanders is due
directly to environment, since the kilt is better suited than
trousers for walking over wet heather.</p>

<p>Another factor besides climate which has exerted a powerful
influence on dress&mdash;more perhaps on what is commonly regarded
as &ldquo;jewelry&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;clothing&rdquo;&mdash;is superstition.
Doubtless many of the smaller objects with which primitive
man adorned himself, especially trophies from the animal world,
were supposed to exert some beneficial or protective influence
on the wearer, or to produce in him the distinguishing characteristics
attributed to the object, or to the whole of which the object
was a part. Such objects might be imitated in other materials
and by successive copying lose their identity, or their first meaning
might be otherwise forgotten, and they would ultimately
exercise a purely decorative function. Though this factor may
be responsible for much, or even the greater part, of primitive
&ldquo;jewelry,&rdquo; yet it does not seem likely that it is the cause of all
forms of ornament; much must be attributed to the desire
to satisfy an innate aesthetic sense, which is seen in children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
and of which some glimmerings appear among the lower animals
also.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">I. Ancient Costume</p>

<p>i. <i>Ancient Oriental.</i>&mdash;Although the numerous discoveries of
monuments, sculptures, wall-paintings, seals, gems, &amp;c., combine
with the evidence from inscriptions and from biblical and classical
writers to furnish a considerable accumulation of material, the
methodical study of costume (in its widest sense) in the ancient
oriental world (western Asia and Egypt) has several difficulties
of its own. It is often difficult to obtain quite accurate or even
adequate reproductions of scenes and subjects, and, when this
is done, it is obviously necessary to refrain from treating the
work of the old artists and sculptors as equivalent to photographic
representations. Art tended to become schematic,
artists were bound by certain limitations and conventions (Egypt
under Amenophis IV. is a notable exception), and their work
was apt to be stilted. In Egypt, too, the spirit of caricature
occasionally shows itself. But when every allowance is made for
the imperfections or the cunning of the workman, one need only
examine any collection of antiquities to see that there was a distinct
appreciation of foreign physical types (not so much for
personal portraiture), costumes, toilet, armour and decoration,
often markedly different from native forms, and that a single
scene (e.g. war, tribute-bearers, captives) will represent varieties
of dress which are consistently observed in other scenes or
which can be substantiated from native sources.<a name="FnAnchor_2p" id="FnAnchor_2p" href="#Footnote_2p"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Important
evidence can thus be obtained on ethnological relations, foreign
influences and the like. Speaking generally, it has been found
that the East as opposed to the West has undergone relatively
little alteration in the principal constituents of dress among the
bulk of the population, and, although it is often difficult to
interpret or explain some of the details as represented (one may
contrast, for example, worn sculptures or seals with the vivid
Egyptian paintings), comparison with later descriptions and even
with modern usage is frequently suggestive. The vocabulary
of old oriental costume is surprisingly large, and some perplexity
is caused by the independent evolution both of the technical
terms (where they are intelligible) and of the articles of dress
themselves. In reality there were numerous minor variations
in the cut and colour of ancient dress even as there are in the
present day in or around Palestine. These differences have
depended upon climate, occupation, occasion (e.g. marriage,
worship, feasts), and especially upon individual status and taste.
Rank has accounted for much, and ceremonial dress&mdash;the apparel
of the gods, their representatives and their ministers&mdash;opens out
several interesting lines of inquiry. The result of intercourse,
whether with other Orientals, or (in later times) with Greeks and
Romans, naturally left its mark, and there have been ages of
increasing luxury followed by periods of reaction, with a general
levelling and nationalization on religious grounds (Judaism,
Islam). All in all the study of oriental costume down to the days
of Hellenism proves to be something more than that of mere
apparel, and any close survey of the evidence speedily raises
questions which concern old oriental history and thought.</p>

<p>The simplest of all coverings is the loin-cloth characteristic
of warm climates, and a necessary protection where there are
trying extremes of temperature. Clothing did not
originate in ideas of decency (Gen. ii. 25, iii. 7). Children
<span class="sidenote">Body-Covering.</span>
ran and still run about naked, the industrious workman
upon the Egyptian monuments is often nude, and the
worshipper would even appear before his deity in a state of
absolute innocence.<a name="FnAnchor_3p" id="FnAnchor_3p" href="#Footnote_3p"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The Hebrews held that the leaves of the
fig-tree (the largest available tree in Palestine) served primitive
man and that the Deity gave them skins for a covering&mdash;evidently
after he had slain the animals (Gen. iii. 21). With this one may
compare the Phoenician myth (now in a late source) which
ascribed the novelty of the use of skins to the hero Us&#333;os
(cf. the biblical Esau, q.v.). The loin-or waist-cloth prevailed
under a very great variety of minor differentiated forms. In
Egypt it was the plain short linen cloth wrapped around the loins
and tied in front (see fig. 1). It was the usual garb of scribes,
servants and peasants, and in the earlier dynasties was worn even
by men of rank. Sometimes,
however, it was of matting or
was seated with leather, or it
would take the form of a narrow
fringed girdle resembling that
of many African tribes. The
Semites who visited Egypt wore
a larger and coloured cloth, ornamented
with parallel stripes of
patterns similar to those found
upon some early specimens of
Palestinian pottery. The border
was fringed or was ornamented
with bunches of tassels. But a
close-fitting skirt or tunic was
more usual, and the Semites on
the famous Beni-Hasan tombs
(about the 20th or 19th century
B.C.) wear richly decorated cloth
(pattern similar to the above),
while the leader is arrayed in a magnificent wrapper in blue,
red and white, with fringed edges, and a neck-ribbon to keep
it in position (see fig. 2).<a name="FnAnchor_4p" id="FnAnchor_4p" href="#Footnote_4p"><span class="sp">4</span></a> In harmony with prevailing custom
the women&rsquo;s dress is rather longer than that of the men, but both
sexes have the arms free and the right shoulder is exposed.
Returning to Egypt we find that the loin-cloth developed downwards
into a skirt falling below the knees. Among the upper
classes it was unusually broad and was made to stand out in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
front in triangular form. In the Middle Kingdom an outer fine
light skirt was worn over the loin-cloth; ordinary people,
however, used thicker material. Egyptian women had a tight
foldless tunic which exposed the breasts; it was generally kept
up by means of braces over the shoulders. This plain diaphanous
garment, without distinction of colour (white, red or yellow), and
with perhaps only an embroidered hem at the top, was worn by
the whole nation, princess and peasant, from the IVth to the
XVIIIth Dynasties (Erman, <i>Life in Ancient Egypt</i>, p. 212).
Variation, such as it was, consisted of a sleeveless dress covering
the shoulders, the neck being cut in the shape of a V. Female
servants and peasants when engaged at work, however, had a
short skirt which left the legs free and the upper part of the
body bare; a like simplicity was probably customary among
female servants or captives throughout (cf. Isa. xlvii. 2). Even
at the present day the wardrobe of the Sinaitic Bedouin is much
more complicated than that of their female folk.</p>

<p>The earliest dress of Babylonia also covered only the lower half
of the body. As worn by gods and men it was a long and rather
loose kind of skirt suspended from a girdle. It is sometimes
smooth; but sometimes it is a shaggy skin (or woollen) skirt
with horizontal rows of vertically furrowed stuff. It allowed a
certain freedom to the legs, but
often it is not clear whether it
was joined down the middle. An
instructive development shows
the upper part of the skirt hanging
over the girdle so that an
elementary mantle would be
obtained by drawing the loose
end up over the shoulders (Meyer,
p. 93, cf. pp. 55, 76). The characteristic
skirt is sometimes supplemented
by a coarse cloth, perhaps
a fleece, thrown over the
shoulders; and in later times it
is seen fastened outside a tunic
by means of a girdle (see fig. 3).</p>

<p>The favourite attitude, one leg
planted firmly before the other,
shows the right leg fully exposed.
A tunic or skirt is found as early
as the time of Naram-Sin, son
of the great Sargon; it reaches
to his knees and appears to be
held up by ornamental shoulder-bands
(Meyer, pp. 11, 115; fig. 4). Egyptian monuments depict
Semites with long bordered tunics reaching from neck to
ankle; they have sleeves, which are sometimes curiously
decorated, and are tied at the neck with tasselled cords; sometimes
there is a peculiar design at the neck resembling a cross
(Müller, <i>Asien und Europa</i>, pp. 298 seq.). The Hittite warriors
upon north Syrian sculptures (Zenj&#299;rli, perhaps 11th to 9th
centuries) have a short-sleeved tunic which ends above the
knees, and this type of garment recurs over a large area with
numerous small variations (with or without girdle, slits at the
neck, or bordering). An interesting example of the long plain
variety is afforded by the prisoners of Lachish before Sennacherib
(701 B.C.); the circumstances and a comparison of the details
would point to its being essentially a simple dress indicative of
mourning and humiliation. It may be compared in its general
form with the woollen <i>jubba</i> of Arabia, which reached to the
knees and was sewn down the front (except at the top and
bottom). A modern Bedouin equivalent has long sleeves; it is
common to both sexes, the chief difference lying in the colour&mdash;white
for men, dyed with indigo for women.</p>

<p>Another very characteristic garment suggests an original
loin-cloth considerably longer than the elementary article which
was noticed above. The Arab <i>iz&#257;r</i>, though now a large outer
wrapper, was once a loin-cloth (like the Hebrew <i>&#277;z&#333;r</i>), which,
however, was long enough to be trodden upon. At the present
day male and female pilgrims at Mecca wear such a cloth (the
<i>i&#7717;r&#257;m</i>); it covers the knees and one end of it may be cast over
the shoulder. In Egyptian tombs have been found linen bands
no less than 30 ft. in length and 3 ft. in width. The distinctive
feature is the spiral arrangement of the garment, the body being
wrapped to a greater or less extent with a bandage of varying
length in more or less parallel stripes. In old Babylonia both the
arms and the whole of the right shoulder were originally uncovered,
and one end of the garment was allowed to hang loose
over the left arm. It is frequently found upon deities, kings and
magnates, and appears to have been composed of some thick
furrowed or fluted material, sometimes of bright and variegated
design. Not seldom it is difficult to distinguish between the true
spiral garment and a dress with parallel horizontal stripes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
one could sometimes suppose that the flounced dress with volants,
well known in the Aegean area, had its parallel in Babylonia.<a name="FnAnchor_5p" id="FnAnchor_5p" href="#Footnote_5p"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
Egypt furnishes admirable painted and sculptured representations
of the forms taken by the Semitic spiral dress in the
XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties; the highly-coloured and gay
apparel of Palestine and Syria standing in the strongest
contrast to the plain, simple and often
scanty garments of the Egyptians (fig. 5).
While the common Semite wore a short
skirt, often with tassels and sometimes
with an upper tunic, the more important
had an elaborate scarf (extending from
waist to knee) wound over the long tunic,
or a longer and close-fitting variety coloured
blue and red and generally adorned with
rich embroidery. A significant feature is
the kind of cape which covers the shoulders,
it would not and no doubt was not intended
to leave play for the arms; it was the
dress of the leisured classes, and a typical
scene depicts the chiefs of Lebanon thus
arrayed submissively felling cedars for
Seti I. (about 1300 B.C.).</p>

<p>Not until the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties does a change
come over Egyptian costume. The Asiatic conquests made
Egypt politically supreme, the centre of life and intercourse, and
the tendency arose to pay some attention to outward appearance.
From the highest to the lowest&mdash;with the important exception
of the priests&mdash;the new age of luxury wiped out the earlier
simplicity. The upper part of the body was covered with a tunic
fastened over the girdle. Often the left arm had a short sleeve
while the right was bare, but flowing sleeves came into use and
various pleated skirts became customary. Garments were
multiplied, and the cape and long mantle, which had previously
been uncommon, were now usual. Fashions changed in quick
succession; upper classes were successively copied by those
beneath them and
were forced to ensure
their dignity by assuming
new styles.
Whether for ordinary
or for special occasions
a great variety
of costume prevailed,
and several types can
be distinguished
among both sexes (Erman,
pp. 207 seq., 213
sqq.; see fig. 6). The
fashionable material
was linen, and although,
according to
Herodotus (ii. 81), a
woollen mantle was
worn over the fringed
linen skirt, wool was
forbidden to the
priests in the temple.
The preference for
fine white linen, quite
in keeping with the
exaggerated Egyptian
ideas of cleanliness,
brought the art of spinning and weaving to a singularly
high level; in embroidery, as in tapestry, however, it is probable
that western Asia more than held its own (see figs. 7 and 8).</p>

<p>Quite distinct from the spiral is the old Babylonian cloak,
which was thrown over the left shoulder, passed under the right
armpit, and hung down, leaving sufficient freedom for the legs.
It is often decorated with a fringed border from top to bottom.
In time this mantle covered both shoulders and assumed sleeves,
and in one form or another it is frequently represented. So
Jehu&rsquo;s tribute-bearers wear short sleeves, trimmed border, and
the general effect could even suggest an Assyrian dress (see fig 9).
Not unlike this is the style on the bilingual Hittite boss of
Tarkudimme, where the skirt ends in a point nearly to the ground
and one leg stands out bare to the front&mdash;the very favourite
attitude. Long fringed robes were worn by Hittites of both
sexes, and the women represented at Mar&rsquo;ash and Zenj&#299;li wear
it hung over the characteristic Hittite cylindrical head-dress
(fig. 10). On the other hand, the unhappy females of Lachish
have a long plain mantle which covers the head and forehead
(fig. 11), and the same principle recurs in modern usage, where the
tunic will be supplemented by a veil or shawl which (generally
bound to the head by a band) frames the face and falls back to
the waist. A large mantle could thus serve as a veil, and
Rebekah covered her face with her square or oblong wrapper on
meeting Isaac (Gen. xxiv. 65). Veiling was ceremonial (1 Cor.
xi. 5), and customary on meeting a future bridegroom or at
marriage (see Gen. xxix. 23-25). Nevertheless veils were not
usually worn out of doors, the countrywoman of to-day is not
veiled, and it is uncertain whether there is any early parallel
for the yashmak, the narrow strip which covers the face below
the eyes and hangs down to the feet.</p>

<p>Before passing to the special covering for the feet and head
some further reference to the Old Testament usage may be made.
Among the Hebrews the outer garment, as distinct from the
inner loin wrapper (&#277;z&#333;r) or tunic, evidently took many forms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
The tunic (<i>kutt&#333;neth</i>, cf. <span class="grk" title="chitôn">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#974;&#957;</span>, <i>tunica</i>), like its Greek counterpart,
was apparently of two kinds, for, although essentially a simple
and probably sleeveless garment, there was a special variety
worn by royal maidens and men of distinction, explicitly
described as a tunic of palms or soles (<i>pass&#299;m</i>), that is, one
presumably reaching to the hands and feet (Gen. xxxvii. 3;
2 Sam. xiii. 18 sq.).<a name="FnAnchor_6p" id="FnAnchor_6p" href="#Footnote_6p"><span class="sp">6</span></a> The <i>kutt&#333;neth</i> could be removed at night
(Cant. v. 3). For the outer garments the most distinctive term
is the <i>simlah</i>. This was worn by both sexes, though obviously
there was some difference as regards length, &amp;c. (Deut. xxii. 5).
Ruth put one on before going out of doors, and its folds could
be used for carrying small loads (Ruth iii. 9; Ex. xii. 34). The
law forbade the creditor to retain it over-night as a pledge
(Ex. xxii. 26 sq.), and consequently we may assume that it was
a large outer wrapper which could be dispensed with out of
doors by men, or indoors by women. The <i>simlah</i> of the warrior
(Isa. ix. 5) can be illustrated from the Assyrian sculptures
(Ency. Bib., art. &ldquo;Siege&rdquo;); according to Herodotus (vii. 69)
the Arabs under Xerxes wore a long cloak fastened by a girdle.
The outer girdle (Heb. <i>&#7717;ag&#333;rah</i>; the Arabic equivalent term
is a kilt from thigh to knee) varied, as the monuments show,
in richness and design, and could be used as a sword-belt or
pocket much in the
same way as the
modern native uses
the long cloth twined
twice or thrice
around his body.
The more ornate
variety, called <i>ab&#328;&#275;t</i>,
was worn by prominent
officials (Isa.
xxii. 21) and by the
high priest. The
modern oriental open
waistcoat finds its
fellow in the jacket
or bolero from ancient Crete, and seems to have been distinctively
Aegean. The same may also be true of breeches.
The pantaloons worn by modern females, with short tunic
and waistcoat, are not found among the Bedouin (e.g. of
Sinai), trousers being considered undignified even for men.
But a baggy kind of knickerbockers is represented in old
Aegean scenes, and it is noteworthy that the Arab <i>mi&rsquo;zar</i>
(drawers such as were worn by wrestlers or sailors) takes its
name from the <i>iz&#257;r</i> or loin-cloth (<i>Ency. Bib.</i> 1734). Such a
cloth may once have passed between the legs, being kept in
position by the waistband (examples in Perrot and Chipiez,
<i>Greece</i>, ii. 198 sq., 456). On the other hand, among the Africans
of Punt the waistcloth passes from each knee to the opposite
thigh, and two sashes hang down to conceal the parts where they
intersect (Müller, 108). The people of Keft (Aegeans) wore a
similar arrangement which is a step in the direction of the proper
drawers. The latter are found exceptionally upon Semitic
Bedouin with an upper covering of bands wound round the body
(Müller, 140). However, the woven decorated drawers in
Cyprus do not appear to be of Semitic origin (J. L. Myres,
<i>Classical Review</i>, x. 355), and it is not until later that they were
prescribed to the Israelite priests (Ezek. xliv. 18). But the
garment as explained by Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> iii. 7. 1) was properly
a <span class="correction" title="amended from lion-cloth">loin-cloth</span> (cf. the examples from Punt), and the reason given
for its use (Ex. xxviii. 42) points to a later date than the law
which enforced the same regard for decency by forbidding the
priests to ascend altars with steps (ib. xx. 26). As trousers were
distinctively Persian&mdash;though the Persians had the reputation
for borrowing Median and foreign dress (Herod. i. 71, vii. 61)&mdash;they
were no doubt familiar in Palestine in the post-exilic age,
and in the Roman period the <i>braccae</i> and <i>feminalia</i> were certainly
known. On supposed references to breeches in Dan. iii. 21, see
<i>Journ. of Philology</i>, xxvi. 307-313.</p>

<p>Special protection for the feet was chiefly necessary in rocky
districts or upon long journeys. In early Egypt men of rank
would be followed by a servant carrying a pair of
sandals in case of need; but in the New Kingdom they
<span class="sidenote">Footgear.</span>
were in common use, although a typical difference is observed
when princes appear unshod in the presence of the Pharaoh,
who wears sandals himself.
The simplest kind
was a pad or sole of
leather or papyrus bound
to the foot by two straps,
one passing over the instep,
the other between
the toes.<a name="FnAnchor_7p" id="FnAnchor_7p" href="#Footnote_7p"><span class="sp">7</span></a> A third was
sometimes fastened behind
the heel, and the
front is often turned up
to protect the toe (Egypt
and elsewhere). The
Semites of the XIIth
Dynasty wore on their
journeys sandals of black
leather, those of the
women and children
being more serviceable, and, in the case of women, parti-coloured.
Practically the same simple sandal came into use
everywhere when required. But the warrior had something
stouter, and the Hittites wore a turned-up shoe bound
round the legs with thongs. Among the latter is also found
a piece of protecting leather reaching halfway up the shin,
and similar developments with tight-fitting bandages, buskins
or laced garters were worn in Assyria and Asia Minor
(see fig. 12). Such coverings find their analogies among the
peasants of modern Cilicia and Cappadocia. Stockings, it may
be added, do not appear, and are quite exceptional at the present
day.</p>

<p>The treatment of the hair, moustache and beard is extremely
interesting in the study of oriental archaeology (see Müller,
Meyer, opp. citt.). A special covering for the head
was not indispensable. The Semites often bound
<span class="sidenote">Headgear.</span>
their bushy locks with a fillet, which varies from a single band
(so often, e.g. Palestinian captives, 10th century) to a fourfold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
one, from a plain band to highly decorated diadems. The
Ethiopians of Tirhakah&rsquo;s army (7th cent.) stuck a single feather
in the front of their fillet, and a feathered ornament recurs from
the old Babylonian goddess with two large feathers on her head
to the feathered crown common from Assur-bani-pal&rsquo;s Arabians
to Ararat, and is familiar from the later distinctive Persian head-dress.<a name="FnAnchor_8p" id="FnAnchor_8p" href="#Footnote_8p"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
But the ordinary Semitic head covering was a cloth
which sometimes appears with two ends tied in front, the third
falling behind. Or it falls over the nape of the neck and is kept
in position with a band; or again as a cloth cap has lappets
to protect the ears. Sometimes it
has a more bulky appearance. In
general, the use of a square or
rectangular cloth (whether folded
diagonally or not) corresponds to
the modern <i>keffiyeh</i> woven with
long fringes which are plaited into
cords knitted at the ends or
worked into little balls sewn over
with coloured silks and golden
threads.<a name="FnAnchor_9p" id="FnAnchor_9p" href="#Footnote_9p"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The <i>keffiyeh</i> covering
cheek, neck and throat, is worn
over a small skull-cap and will
be accompanied with the relatively
modern fez (<i>tarb&#363;sh</i>) and a woollen cloth. Probably
the oldest head-dress is the circular close-fitting cap
(plain or braided), which, according to Meyer, is of Sumerian
(non-Semitic) origin. But it has a long history. Palestinian
captives in the Assyrian age wear it with a plain close-fitting
tunic, and it appears upon the god Hadad in north Syria (cf.
also the Gezer seal, fig. 13). With some deities (e.g. the
moon-god Sin) it has a kind of straight brim which gives it a
certain resemblance to a low-crowned &ldquo;bowler.&rdquo; Very characteristic
is the conical cap which, like the Persian hat (Gr. <i>kurbasia</i>),
resembled a cock&rsquo;s comb. It is worn by gods and men, and with
the latter sometimes has ear-flaps (at Lachish, with other
varieties, Ball, 190) or is surmounted by a feather or crest. It
was probably made of plaited leather or felt. Veritable helmets
of metal, such as Herodotus ascribes to
Assyrians and Chalybians (vii. 63, 76), and
metal armour, though known farther
west, scarcely appear in old oriental
costume, and the passage which attributes
bronze helmets and coats of mail
to the Philistine Goliath and the Israelite
Saul cannot be held (on other grounds) to
be necessarily reliable for the middle or
close of the 11th century (1 Sam. xvii).
A loftier head-covering was sometimes
spherical at the top and narrowed in the
middle; with a brim or border turned up
back and front it is worn by Hittite
warriors of Zenj&#299;rli and by their god of
storm and war (fig. 14). Elongated and
more pointed it is the archaic crown of
the Pharaohs (symbolical of upper Egypt),
is worn by a Hittite god of the 14th
century, and finds parallels upon old
cultus images from Asia Minor, Crete and
Cyprus. Later, Herodotus describes it as
distinctively Scythian (vii. 64). Finally the cylindrical hat of
Hittite kings and queens reappears with lappets in Phoenicia
(Perrot and Chipiez, <i>Phoen.</i> ii. 77); without the brim it resembles
the crown ofthe Babylonian Merodach-nadin-akhi, with a feathered
top it distinguishes Adad (god of storm, &amp;c.) at Babylonia.
Narrower at the top and surmounted by a spike it distinguishes
the Assyrian kings.</p>

<p>When the deities were regarded as anthropomorphic they
naturally wore clothing which, on the whole, was less subject
to change of fashion and was apt to be symbolical of
their attributes. The old Babylonian hero Gilgamesh
<span class="sidenote">Costume of the Gods.</span>
and the Egyptian Bes (perhaps of foreign extraction)
are nude, and so in general are the figurines of the
Ishtar-Astarte type. Numerous bronze images of a kneeling
god at Telloh give him only a loin-cloth, and often the deity, like
the monarch, has only a skirt. In course of time various plaids
or mantles are assumed, and in Babylonia the goddesses were
the first to have both shoulders covered. Distinctive features
are found in the head-dress, e.g. crowns (cf. the Ammonite god,
2 Sam. xii. 30) or horns (a single pair or an arrangement of four
pairs), and in Babylonia symbolical emblems are attached to the
shoulders (e.g. the rays of the sun-god, stalks, running water).
Long garments ornamented with symbolical designs (stars, &amp;c.)
are worn by Marduk and Adad. The custom of clothing images
is well known in the ancient world, and at the restoration of an
Egyptian temple care was taken to anoint the divine limbs and to
prepare the royal linen for the god. The ceremonial clothing
of the god on the occasion of festal processions, undertaken in
Egypt by the &ldquo;master of secret things,&rdquo; may be compared with
the well-known Babylonian representations of such promenades.
The Babylonian temples received garments as payment in kind,
and the Egyptian lists in the Papyrus Harris (Rameses III.)
enumerate an enormous number of skirts, tunics and mantles,
dyed and undyed, for the various deities. A priest, &ldquo;master of
the wardrobe,&rdquo; is named as early as the VIth Dynasty, and later
texts refer to the weavers and laundry servants of the temple.
It is probable that 2 Kings xxiii. 7 originally referred to the
women who wove garments for the goddess in the temple at
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In Egypt the king was regarded as the incarnation of the deity,
his son and earthly likeness. The underlying conception shows
itself under differing though not unrelated forms over
western Asia, and in their light the question of religious
<span class="sidenote">Royal costume.</span>
and ceremonial dress is of great interest. Throughout
Egyptian history the official costume was conventionalized, and
the latest kings and even the Roman emperors are arrayed like
their predecessors of the IVth Dynasty. The crook which figures
among royal and divine insignia may go back to the boomerang-like
object which was a prominent weapon in antiquity (Müller,
123 sq.). It appears in old Babylonia as a curved stick, and,
like the club, is a distinctive symbol of god and king. It resembles
the sceptre curved at the end, which was carried by old Hittite
gods. The Pharaoh&rsquo;s characteristic crown (or crowns)
symbolized his royal domains, the sacred uraeus marked his
divine ancestry, and he sometimes appeared in the costume
of the gods with their fillets adorned with double feathers and
horns. In Babylonia Naram-Sin in the guise of a god wears the
pointed helmet and two great horns distinctive of the deities.<a name="FnAnchor_10p" id="FnAnchor_10p" href="#Footnote_10p"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
This relationship between the gods and their human representatives
is variously expressed. Khammurabi and the sun-god
Shamash, on the former&rsquo;s famous code of laws, have the same
features and almost the same frizzled beard, and, according to
Meyer, the king in claiming supremacy over Sumer and Akkad
wears the costume of the lands.<a name="FnAnchor_11p" id="FnAnchor_11p" href="#Footnote_11p"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Ordinary folk could not claim
these honours, and in Egypt, where shaving was practically
universal, artificial beards were worn upon solemn occasions as a
peculiar duty. But the appendage of the official was shorter
than that of the king, and the gods had a distinctive shape for
themselves; if it appears upon the dead it is because they in
their death had become identified with the god Osiris (Erman,
59, 225 sq.). Young Egyptian princes and youthful kings had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
a long plaited lock (or later a lappet) on the side of their head in
imitation of the youthful Horus, and the peculiar tonsure adopted
by the later Arabs of Sinai was inspired by the desire to copy their
god Orotal-Dionysus.<a name="FnAnchor_12p" id="FnAnchor_12p" href="#Footnote_12p"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Thus we perceive that ancient costume
and toilet involves the relations between the gods and men,
and also, what is extremely important, the political conditions
among the latter. When the king symbolizes both the god and
the extent of his kingdom, ceremonies which could appear
commonplace often acquire a new significance, any discussion of
which belongs to the intricacies of the history of religion and
pre-monarchical society. It must suffice, therefore, to record the
Pharaoh&rsquo;s simple girdle (with or without a tunic) from which
hangs the lion&rsquo;s tail, or the tail-like band suspended from the
extremity of his head-dress (above), or the panther or leopard
skin worn over the shoulders by the high priest at Memphis,
subsequently a ceremonial dress of men of rank. That the
Pharaoh&rsquo;s skirt, sometimes decorated with a pleated golden
material, should become an honorific garment, the right of wearing
which was proudly recorded among the bearer&rsquo;s titles, is
quite intelligible, but many difficulties arise when one attempts
to identify the individuals represented, or to trace the evolution
of ideas.<a name="FnAnchor_13p" id="FnAnchor_13p" href="#Footnote_13p"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p>The well-known conservatism of religious practice manifests
itself in ceremonial festivals (where there is a tendency for the
original religious meaning to be obscured) and among
the priests, and it is interesting to observe that despite
<span class="sidenote">Ceremonial costume.</span>
the great changes in Egyptian costume in the New
Kingdom the priests still kept to the simple linen
skirt of earlier days (Erman, 206). Religious dress (whether of
priests or worshippers) was regulated by certain fundamental
ideas concerning access to the deity and its consequences. That
it was proper to wear special garments (or at least to rearrange
one&rsquo;s weekday clothes) on the Jewish sabbath was recognized in
the Talmud, and Mahommedans, after discussing at length the
most suitable raiment for prayer, favoured the use of a single
simple garment (Bukh&#257;ri, viii.). It was a deep-seated belief
that those who took part in religious functions were liable to
communicate this &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; to others (compare the complex
ideas associated with the Polynesian taboo). Hence priests would
remove their ceremonial dress before leaving the sanctuary &ldquo;that
they sanctify not the people with their garments&rdquo; (Ezek. xliv.
19; cf. xlii. 14), and every precaution was taken on religious
occasions to ensure purity by special ablutions and by cleansing
the clothes.<a name="FnAnchor_14p" id="FnAnchor_14p" href="#Footnote_14p"><span class="sp">14</span></a> In the old ritual at Mecca, the man who wore his
own garments must leave them in the sanctuary, as they had
become &ldquo;taboo&rdquo;; hence the sacred circumambulation of the
Ka&rsquo;ba was performed naked (prohibited by Mahomet), or in
clothes provided for the occasion. The old archaic waist-cloth
was used, and at the present day both male and female pilgrims
enter bare-footed and clad in the scanty <i>i&#7717;r&#257;m</i> (C. M. Doughty,
<i>Arabia Deserta</i>, ii. 479, 481, 537). In several old Babylonian
representations the priests or worshippers appear before the
deity in a state of nature.<a name="FnAnchor_15p" id="FnAnchor_15p" href="#Footnote_15p"><span class="sp">15</span></a> It is known that laymen were
required to wear special garments, and the priests (who wore
dark-red or purple) were sometimes called upon to change their
garments in the course of a ceremony. Thus the temples required
clothing not merely for the gods but also for the attendants
(so at Samaria, 2 Kings x. 22).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the late usage at Harran the worshipper, after purifying his
garments and his heart, was advised to put on the clothing of the
particular god he addressed (de Goeje, <i>Oriental Congress</i>, Leiden,
1883, pp. 341 sqq.). The reason is obvious, and the principle could
be variously expressed. But we are not told whether the prophetess
who wore bands on her arm and drew a mantle over her head (so
read in Ezek. xiii. 17-23) actually used the clothing peculiar to some
deity, nor is it quite clear what is meant when a Babylonian ritual
text refers to the magical use of the linen garment of Eridu (seat of
the cult of Ea). The Bishop Gregentius denounced as heathenish
the rites in which the Arabs wore masks (W. R. Smith, 438), and one
is tempted to compare the use of masks elsewhere in animal worship.
Next, one may observe upon old Babylonian seals, eagle-headed
deities with short feathered skirts attended by human beings similarly
arrayed (Ball, 151) or figures draped in a fish skin (Menant, <i>Rev. de
l&rsquo;hist. des relig.</i> xi. 295-301) or a worshipper arrayed somewhat
like a cock (Meyer, 63; cf. Lucian&rsquo;s <i>De Dea Syria</i>, § 48; for &ldquo;bees,&rdquo;
&amp;c., as titles of sacred attendants, see J. G. Frazer, <i>Pausanias</i>, iv.
223, v. 621). Although there is much that is obscure in this line of
research, it is a natural assumption that, in those ritual functions
where the gods were supposed to participate, the rôle was taken by
men, and the general idea of assimilating oneself to the god (and the
reverse process) manifests itself in too many ways to be ignored
(cf. W. R. Smith, 293, 437 sq., 474; C. J. Ball, <i>Ency. Bib.</i>, art.
&ldquo;Cuttings&rdquo;). But the deities were not originally anthropomorphic,
and it is with the earlier stages in their development that some
of the more remarkable costumes are apparently concerned.</p>
</div>

<p>Of all priestly costumes<a name="FnAnchor_16p" id="FnAnchor_16p" href="#Footnote_16p"><span class="sp">16</span></a> the most interesting is undoubtedly
that of the Jewish Levitical high-priest. In addition to a tunic
(kutt&#333;neth) and a seamless mantle or robe (<i>m&#277;&rsquo;&#299;l</i>), he wore the
breastplate (<i>&#7717;&#333;shen</i>), the ephod, and a rich outer girdle. Breeches
were assumed on the Day of Atonement. His head-dress was
as distinctive as that of the high priest at Hierapolis, who wore
a golden tiara and a purple dress, while the ordinary priests had a
<i>pilos</i> (conical cap, also worn in Israel, Ex. xxviii. 40) and white
garments. But the various descriptions cannot be easily reconciled.<a name="FnAnchor_17p" id="FnAnchor_17p" href="#Footnote_17p"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
The robe had pomegranates and golden bells that the
sound might give warning as he went in and out of the sanctuary,
and &ldquo;that he died not&rdquo; (Ex. xxviii. 35). According to Josephus
they symbolized the lightning and thunder respectively. The
&ldquo;ephod of prophecy&rdquo; (so <i>Test. of Levi</i>, viii. 2) was essentially
once an object of divination (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ephod</a></span>). The &ldquo;breastplate
of judgment&rdquo; was set with twelve jewels engraved with the
names of the tribes; the foreordained covering of the semi-divine
being in the garden of the gods bore the same number
of stones (Ezek. xxviii. 13, Septuagint). This breast ornament
finds analogies in the royal and high priestly dress of Egypt,
and in the six jewels of the Babylonian king.<a name="FnAnchor_18p" id="FnAnchor_18p" href="#Footnote_18p"><span class="sp">18</span></a> The sacred lots
which gave &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; in accordance with the divine oracle
(Num. xxvii. 21) have been plausibly compared with the Babylonian
tablets of destiny worn by the gods and the mystic lots upon
the bosom of Noah.<a name="FnAnchor_19p" id="FnAnchor_19p" href="#Footnote_19p"><span class="sp">19</span></a> The two jewels also engraved with the
names of the tribes in a suitable setting, worn upon the <i>shoulder</i>
(see p. 102, c.), served, like the twelve mentioned, for a memorial
before the Deity, effectively bringing them to remembrance,
without any action on the part of the bearer, and thus tacitly
involving supernatural intervention as amulets are regularly
expected to do. The golden plate inscribed &ldquo;holy to Yahweh&rdquo;
placed over the head (the details are discrepant) had a mystic
atoning force (Ex. xxviii. 38), and in general writers recognized
the peculiar efficacy of the costume and its symbolical meaning
(Philo, <i>Vita Mosis</i>, iii. 14; Jos. <i>Ant.</i> iii. 7. 7; Talm. <i>Zeb.</i> 88b).
Although Jewish tradition ascribed this gorgeous and significant
array to the Mosaic age (if not to the pre-Mosaic days of Levi,
so the <i>Test. of Levi</i>), its very character, in common with the
high priest&rsquo;s status, combines kingly and priestly powers in a
manner which is impossible for the period (about 15th-13th cent.).
Where the king is the human representative of the Deity he is
theoretically and officially the priesthood, although the priests
carry on the ordinary subordinate functions. The Hebrew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
kings, at all events, undertook priestly duties, and not until after
the fall of Jerusalem does the history allow that usurpation of
monarchical rights upon which the prophet Ezekiel (q.v.) encroaches.
The embodiment of political and religious supremacy
displayed in the high priest&rsquo;s authority, clothing and symbols
can only reflect exilic or rather post-exilic conditions.<a name="FnAnchor_20p" id="FnAnchor_20p" href="#Footnote_20p"><span class="sp">20</span></a> (See
further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Priest</a></span>.) In the Maccabaean age the high priest Jonathan
received the purple robe and crown and the buckle of gold worn
on the shoulder as a sign of priestly and secular rank (1 Macc.
x. 20, 38, 89, xi. 58). His brother Simon received similar honours
(xiv. 48 sq.), and Hyrcanus, the &ldquo;second David,&rdquo; was supposed
to have had two crowns, one royal and the other priestly (Talm.
<i>Kidd.</i> 66a). The later Rabbis wore most sumptuous apparel,
and were crowned until the death of Eliezer ben Azarya.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Thus there was a real significance in ceremonial investiture (cf.
Num. xx. 26, 28) and in the transference of clothes (cf. Elisha and
Elijah&rsquo;s mantle, 2 Kings ii. 13). Further the exchange of garments
was not meaningless, and the prohibition in Deut. xxii. 5 points to
religious or superstitious beliefs, on which see J. G. Frazer, <i>Adonis,
Attis and Osiris</i> (2nd ed.), pp. 428-435. On the claim involved by
the act of throwing a garment over another (Ruth iii. 9; cf. 1 Kings
xix. 19), see W. R. Smith, <i>Kinship and Marriage</i><a name="FnAnchor_21p" id="FnAnchor_21p" href="#Footnote_21p"><span class="sp">21</span></a>, 105 sq.; J. Wellhausen,
<i>Archiv f. Religionswiss</i>. (1907), pp. 40 sqq.; and on some
interesting ideas associated with sandals, see <i>Ency. Bib.</i>, s.v. &ldquo;Shoes.&rdquo;
As a sign of grief, or on any occasion when the individual felt himself
brought into closer contact with his deity, the garments were rent
(subsequently a conventional slit at the breast sufficed) and he
donned the <i>sak</i>, a loin-cloth or wrapper which appears to be a survival
of older and more primitive dress.<a href="#Footnote_21p"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Later tradition (Mish., Kil.
ix. 1) does not endorse Ezekiel&rsquo;s prohibition of woollen garments
among the priests in the sanctuary (xliv. 17 sq.). Why the layman
was forbidden a mixture of wool and linen (<i>sha&rsquo;atn&#275;z</i>, Deut. xxii. 11)
is difficult to explain, though Maimonides perhaps correctly regarded
the law as a protest against heathenism (on the magical use of
representatives of the animal and vegetable kingdom, in conjunction
with a metal ring, see I. Goldziher, <i>Zeit. f. alttest. Wissens.</i> xx. 36 sq.).</p>
</div>

<p>Ancient oriental costume then cannot be severed from the
history and development of thought. On the one side we may
see the increase of rich apparel and the profusion of clothes by
which people of rank indicated their position. On the other are
such figures as the Hebrew prophets, distinguished by their
hairy garment and by their denunciation of the luxury of both
sexes.<a name="FnAnchor_22p" id="FnAnchor_22p" href="#Footnote_22p"><span class="sp">22</span></a> Superfluous clothing was both weakening and deteriorating;
this formed the point of the advice of Croesus to Cyrus
(Herod. i. 155). But &ldquo;foreign apparel&rdquo; was only too apt to
involve ideas of foreign worship (Zeph. i. 8. sq.), and the recognition
that national costume, custom and morality were inseparable
underlay the objection to the Greek cap (the <span class="grk" title="petasos">&#960;&#941;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#959;&#962;</span>) introduced
among the Jews under Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Macc. iv. 10-17,
with the parallel 1 Macc. i. 11-15). The Israelite distinctive
costume and toilet as part of a distinctive national religion
was in harmony with oriental thought, and, as a people chosen
and possessed by Yahweh, &ldquo;a kingdom of priests and an holy
nation&rdquo; (Ex. xix. 5 sq.; cf. Is. lxi. 6), certain outward signs
assumed a new significance and continued to be cherished by
orthodox Jews as tokens of their faith. The tassels attached by
blue threads to the four corners of the outer garment were
unique only as regards the special meaning attached to them
(Num. xv. 37-41; Deut. xxii. 12), and when in the middle ages
they marked out the Jew for persecution they were transferred to
a small under-garment (the little <i>t&#257;l&#299;th</i>), the proper <i>t&#257;l&#299;th</i> being
worn over the head in the synagogue. Similarly, sentences
bound on the left arm or placed upon the forehead (Deut. xi.
18, cf. the high priest&rsquo;s plate) find analogies in the means taken
elsewhere to ensure the protection of or to manifest one&rsquo;s
adherence to a deity; the novelty lies in the part these sentences
took in the religion (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Phylactery</a></span>). While the particular
prohibition regarding the beard and hair in Lev. xix. 27 (cf.
Ezek. xliv. 20) was for the avoidance of heathen customs, the
<i>p&#275;y&#333;th</i> or long curls which became typical in the middle ages are
reminiscent of the Horns-curl of Egypt and the Mahommedan
&ldquo;heaven lock&rdquo; and evidently served as positive distinctive
marks. Apart from these details later Jewish dress does not
belong to this section. In the Greek and Roman period foreign
influence shows itself very strongly in the introduction of novelties
of costume and of classical terms, and the subject belongs rather
to the Greek and Roman dress of the age.<a name="FnAnchor_23p" id="FnAnchor_23p" href="#Footnote_23p"><span class="sp">23</span></a> Two conflicting
tendencies were constantly at work, and reached their climax in
the middle ages. There was an anxiety to avoid articles of dress
peculiar to other religions, especially when these were associated
with religious practices; and there was a willingness to refrain
from costume contrary to the customs of an unsympathetic land.
On the one hand, there was a conservatism which is exemplified
when the Jews in course of immigration took with them the
characteristic dress of their former adopted home, or when they
remained unmoved by the changes of the Renaissance. On the
other hand, the prominent badge enforced by Pope Innocent III.
in 1215 was intended to prevent Jews from being mistaken for
Christians, and similarly in Mahommedan lands they were
compelled to wear some distinctive indication of their sect.
Thus the many quaint and interesting features of later Jewish
costume have arisen from certain specific causes, any consideration
of which concerns later and medieval costume generally.

xv. sq.; and especially the <i>Jew. Encyc.</i>, s.v. &ldquo;Dress&rdquo; (with

illustrated books (especially C. J. Ball, <i>Light from the East</i>, London,

<p>ii. <i>Aegean Costume.</i>&mdash;The discoveries made at Mycenae and
other centres of &ldquo;Mycenaean&rdquo; civilization, and those of more
recent date due to the excavations of Dr
A. J. Evans and others in Crete, have shown
that Hellenic culture was preceded in the
Aegean by a civilization differing from it in
many respects (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aegean Civilization</a></span>),
and not least in costume. The essential
feature both of male and female dress during
the &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mycenaean&rdquo; periods
was the loin-cloth, which is best represented
by the votive terra-cotta statuettes from
Petsofá in Crete discovered by Professor
J. L. Myres and published in the ninth
volume of the <i>Annual of the British School
at Athens</i> (fig. 15). J. L. Myres shows that
the costume consists of three parts&mdash;the
loin-cloth itself, a white wrapper or kilt
worn over it, and a knotted girdle which
secured the whole and perhaps played its
part in producing and maintaining the wasp
waists characteristic of the Aegean race.
The loin-cloth was the only costume (except for high boots,
probably made of pale leather, since they are represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
with white paint) regularly worn by the male sex, though
we sometimes find a hood or wrapper, as on a lead statuette
found in Laconia (fig. 16), but the Aegean women developed
it into a bodice-and-skirt costume, well represented by the
frescoes of Cnossus and
the statuettes of the
snake-goddess and her
votaries there discovered.
This transformation
of the loin-cloth
has been illustrated
by Mr D. Mackenzie (see
below) from Cretan seal-impressions.
In place
of the belted kilt of the
men we find a belted
panier or polonaise, considerably
elongated in
front, worn by Aegean
women; and Mackenzie
shows that this was repeated
several times
until it formed the
compound skirt with a
number of flounces which
is represented on many
Mycenaean gems. On a fresco discovered at Phaestus (Hagia
Triada) (fig. 17) and a sealing from the same place this multiple
skirt is clearly shown as divided; but this does not seem to have
been the general rule. On other sealings we find a single overskirt
with a pleated underskirt. The skirts were held in place by a
thick rolled belt, and the upper part of the body remained quite
nude in the earliest times; but from the middle Minoan period
onward we often find an important addition in the shape of a
low-cut bodice, which sometimes has sleeves, either tight-fitting or
puffed, and ultimately develops into a laced corsage. A figurine
from Petsofá (fig. 18) shows the bodice-and-skirt costume,
together with a high pointed head-dress, in one of its most
elaborate forms. The bodice has a high peaked collar at the
back. Other forms of head-dress are seen on the great signet
from Mycenae. The fact that both male and female costume
amongst the primitive Aegean peoples is derivable from the
simple loin-cloth with additions is rightly used by Mackenzie as a
proof that their original home is not to be sought in the colder
regions of central Europe, but in a warm climate such as that of
North Africa. It is not until the latest Mycenaean period that
we find brooches, such as were used in historical Greece, to fasten
woollen garments, and their presence in the tombs of the lower
city of Mycenae indicates the coming of a northern race.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Greek Costume.</i>&mdash;All articles of Greek costume belong
either to the class of <span class="grk" title="endymata">&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, more or less close-fitting, sewn
garments, or of <span class="grk" title="periblêmata">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, loose pieces of stuff draped round
the body in various ways and fastened with pins or brooches.
For the former class the generic name is <span class="grk" title="chitôn">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#974;&#957;</span>, a word of Semitic
origin, which denotes the Eastern origin of the garment; for the
latter we find in Homer and early poetry <span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, in later times
<span class="grk" title="himation">&#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>. The <span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> (also called <span class="grk" title="eanos">&#7953;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span> and <span class="grk" title="pharos">&#966;&#8118;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> in Homer)
was the sole indispensable article of dress in early Greece, and,
as it was always retained as such by the women in Dorian states,
is often called the &ldquo;Doric dress&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="esthês Dôris">&#7952;&#963;&#952;&#8052;&#962; &#916;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#962;</span>). It was a square
piece of woollen stuff about a foot longer than the height of the
wearer, and equal in breadth to twice the span of the arms
measured from wrist to wrist. The upper edge was folded over
for a distance equal to the space from neck to waist&mdash;this folded
portion was called <span class="grk" title="apoptygma">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#964;&#965;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span> or <span class="grk" title="diplois">&#948;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#8146;&#962;</span>,&mdash;and the whole garment
was then doubled and wrapped round the body below the armpits,
the left side being closed and the right open. The back and
front were then pulled up over the shoulders and fastened
together with brooches like safety-pins (<span class="grk" title="peronai">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>). This was the
Doric costume, which left the right side of the body exposed
and provoked the censure of Euripides (<i>Andr</i>. 598). It was
usual, however, to hold the front and back of the <span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> together
by a girdle (<span class="grk" title="zônê">&#950;&#974;&#957;&#951;</span>), passed round the waist below the <span class="grk" title="apoptygma">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#964;&#965;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span>;
the superfluous length of the garment was pulled up through the
girdle and allowed to fall over in a baggy fold (<span class="grk" title="kolpos">&#954;&#972;&#955;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>) (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, fig. 75). Sometimes the <span class="grk" title="apoptygma">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#960;&#964;&#965;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span> was made long
enough to fall below the waist, and the girdle passed outside
it (cf. the figure of Artemis on the vase shown in <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, fig.
29); this was the fashion in which the Athena Parthenos of
Pheidias was draped. The &ldquo;Attic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Corinthian&rdquo; <span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>
was sewn together on the right side from below the arm, and thus
became an <span class="grk" title="endyma">&#7956;&#957;&#948;&#965;&#956;&#945;</span>. The <span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> was worn in a variety of colours
and often decorated with bands of ornament, both horizontal
and vertical; Homer uses the epithets <span class="grk" title="krokopeplos">&#954;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#949;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> and
<span class="grk" title="kyanopeplos">&#954;&#965;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#960;&#949;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, which show that yellow and dark blue <span class="grk" title="peploi">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> were
worn, and speaks of embroidered <span class="grk" title="peploi">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> (<span class="grk" title="poikiloi">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span>). Such
embroideries are indicated by painting on the statues from the
Acropolis and are often shown on vase paintings.</p>

<p>The chiton, <span class="grk" title="chitôn">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#974;&#957;</span>, was formed by sewing together at the
sides two pieces of linen, or a double piece folded together, leaving
spaces at the top for the arms and neck, and fastening the top
edges together over the shoulders and upper arm with buttons
or brooches; more rarely we find a plain sleeveless chiton. The
length of the garment varied considerably. The <span class="grk" title="chitôniskos">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>,
worn in active exercise, as by the so-called &ldquo;Atalanta&rdquo; of the
Vatican, or the well-known Amazon statues (<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, fig.
40), reached only to the knee; the <span class="grk" title="chitôn podêrês">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#8060;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#948;&#942;&#961;&#951;&#962;</span> covered the
feet. This long, trailing garment was especially characteristic
of Ionia; in the Homeric poems (Il. xiii. 685) we read of the
<span class="grk" title="Iaones helkechitônes">&#906;&#945;&#972;&#957;&#949;&#962; &#7953;&#955;&#954;&#949;&#967;&#943;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span>. If worn without a girdle it went by the
name of <span class="grk" title="chitôn orthostadios">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#8060;&#957; &#8000;&#961;&#952;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>. The long chiton was regularly
used by musicians (e.g. Apollo the lyre-player) and charioteers.
In ordinary life it was generally pulled up through the girdle
and formed a <span class="grk" title="kolpos">&#954;&#972;&#955;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> (<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, fig. 2).</p>

<p>Herodotus (v. 82-88) tells a story (cf. <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aegina</a></span>), the details
of which are to all appearance legendary, in order to account
for a change in the fashion of female dress which took place at
Athens in the course of the 6th century B.C. Up to that time
the &ldquo;Dorian dress&rdquo; had been universal, but the Athenians now
gave up the use of garments fastened with pins or brooches, and
adopted the linen chiton of the Ionians. The statement of
Herodotus is illustrated both by Attic vase-paintings and also
by the series of archaic female statues from the Acropolis of
Athens, which (with the exception of one clothed in the Doric
<span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>) wear the Ionic chiton, together with an outer garment,
sometimes laid over both shoulders like a cloak (<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>,
fig. 3), but more usually fastened on the right shoulder only, and
passed diagonally across the body so as to leave the left arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
free. The garment (which resembles the Doric <span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, but
seems to have been rectangular rather than square) is folded
over at the top, and the central part is drawn up towards the
right shoulder to produce an elaborate system of zigzag folds
(<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, fig. 22). The borders of the garment are painted
with geometrical patterns in vivid colours; a broad stripe of
ornament runs down the centre of the skirt.<a name="FnAnchor_24p" id="FnAnchor_24p" href="#Footnote_24p"><span class="sp">24</span></a></p>

<p>This fashion of dress was only temporary. Thucydides (i. 6)
tells us that in his own time the linen chiton of Ionia had again
been discarded in favour of the Doric dress, and the monuments
show that after the Persian wars a reaction against Orientalism
showed itself in a return to simpler fashions. The long
linen chiton, which had been worn by men as well as women,
was now only retained by the male sex on religious and festival
occasions; a short chiton was, however, worn at work or in
active exercise (<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, fig. 3) and often fastened on the
left shoulder only, when it was called <span class="grk" title="chitôn heteromaschalos">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#8060;&#957; &#7953;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> or
<span class="grk" title="exômis">&#7952;&#958;&#969;&#956;&#943;&#962;</span>. But the garment usually worn by men of mature age
was the <span class="grk" title="himation">&#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, which was (like the <span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>) a plain square of
woollen stuff. One corner of this was pulled over the left shoulder
from the back and tucked in under the left arm; the rest of the
garment was brought round the right side of the body and either
carried under the right shoulder, across the chest and over the
left shoulder, if it was desired that the right arm should be free,
or wrapped round the right arm as well as the body, leaving the
right hand in a fold like a sling (<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, fig. 2). The <span class="grk" title="himation">&#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>
was also worn by women over the linen chiton, and draped in a
great variety of ways, which may be illustrated by the terra-cotta
figurines from Tanagra (4th-3rd cent. B.C.) and the numerous
types of female statues, largely represented by copies of Roman
date, made to serve as grave-monuments. The upper part of
the <span class="grk" title="himation">&#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> was often drawn over the head as in the example here
shown (Plate, fig. 21), a statue formerly in the duke of Sutherland&rsquo;s
collection at Trentham and now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>A lighter garment was the <span class="grk" title="chlamys">&#967;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#973;&#962;</span>, <i>chlamys</i>, a mantle worn by
young men, usually over a short chiton girt at the waist, and
fastened on the right shoulder (cf. the figure of Hermes in <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek
Art</a></span>, fig. 2). The <span class="grk" title="chlaina">&#967;&#955;&#945;&#8150;&#957;&#945;</span> was a heavy woollen cloak worn in
cold weather. Peasants wore sheepskins or garments of hide
called <span class="grk" title="baitê">&#946;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#951;</span> or <span class="grk" title="sisura">&#963;&#943;&#963;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>; slaves, who were required by custom
to conceal their limbs as much as possible, wore a sleeved chiton
and long hose.</p>

<p>A woman&rsquo;s head was usually covered by drawing up the
<span class="grk" title="himation">&#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> (see above), but sometimes instead of this, a separate
piece of cloth was made to perform this service, the end of it
falling over the <i>himation</i>. This was the <span class="grk" title="kalyptra">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#973;&#960;&#964;&#961;&#945;</span>, or veil called
<span class="grk" title="krêdemnon">&#954;&#961;&#942;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span> in Homer. A cap merely intended to cover in the
hair and hold it together was called <span class="grk" title="kekryphalos">&#954;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#973;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>. When the
object was only to hold up the hair from the neck, the <span class="grk" title="sphendonê">&#963;&#966;&#949;&#957;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#951;</span>
was used, which, as its name implies, was in the form of a sling;
but in this case it was called more particularly <span class="grk" title="opisthosphendonê">&#8000;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#949;&#957;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#951;</span>,
as a distinction from the <i>sphendon&#275;</i> when worn in front of the
head. The head ornaments include the <span class="grk" title="diadêma">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#945;</span>, a narrow band
bound round the hair a little way back from the brow and
temples, and fastened in the knot of the hair behind; the <span class="grk" title="ampux">&#7940;&#956;&#960;&#965;&#958;</span>,
a variety of the diadem; the <span class="grk" title="stephanê">&#963;&#964;&#949;&#966;&#940;&#957;&#951;</span>, a crown worn over the
forehead, its highest point being in the centre, and narrowing at
each side into a thin band which is tied at the back of the head.
It is doubtful whether this should be distinguished from the
<span class="grk" title="stephanos">&#963;&#964;&#941;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, a crown of the same breadth and design all round, as
on the coins of Argos with the head of Hera, who is expressly
said by Pausanias to wear a <i>stephanos</i>. This word is also employed
for crowns of laurel, olive or other plant. High crowns made of
wicker-work (<span class="grk" title="poloi, kalathoi">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#953;, &#954;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#953;</span>) were also worn (see Gerhard,
<i>Antike Bildwerke</i>, pls. 303-305). When the hair, as was most
usual, was gathered back from the temples and fastened in a knot
behind, hair-pins were required, and these were mostly of bone or
ivory, mounted with gold or plain; so also when the hair was
tied in a large knot above the forehead, as in the case of Artemis,
or of Apollo as leader of the Muses. The early Athenians wore
their hair in the fashion termed <span class="grk" title="krôbylos">&#954;&#961;&#974;&#946;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, with fastenings called
&ldquo;grasshoppers&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="tettiges">&#964;&#941;&#964;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#949;&#962;</span>), in allusion to their claim of having
originally sprung from the soil (Thuc. i. 6). The <span class="grk" title="tettiges">&#964;&#941;&#964;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#949;&#962;</span> have
been identified by Helbig with small spirals of gold wire, such as
are found in early Etruscan tombs lying near the head of the
skeleton. Such spirals were used in early Athens to confine the back
hair, and this fashion may therefore be identified as the <span class="grk" title="krôbylos">&#954;&#961;&#974;&#946;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>.
In archaic figures the hair is most frequently arranged over the
brow and temples in parallel rows of small curls which must have
been kept in their places by artificial means. Ear-rings (<span class="grk" title="enôtia, ellobia, heliktêres">&#7952;&#957;&#974;&#964;&#953;&#945;, &#7952;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#945;, &#7953;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#964;&#8134;&#961;&#949;&#962;</span>) of gold, silver, or bronze plated with gold,
and frequently ornamented with pearls, precious stones, or
enamel, were worn attached to the lobes of the ear. For necklaces
(<span class="grk" title="hormoi">&#8005;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#953;</span>), bracelets (<span class="grk" title="opheis">&#8004;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>), brooches (<span class="grk" title="peronai">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>), and finger-rings
(<span class="grk" title="daktylioi">&#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#973;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#953;</span> or <span class="grk" title="sphragides">&#963;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>) the same variety and preciousness
of material was employed. For the feet the sandal (<span class="grk" title="sandalon, pedilon">&#963;&#940;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#957;, &#960;&#941;&#948;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>)
was the usual wear; for hunting and travelling high
boots were worn. The hunting-boot (<span class="grk" title="endromis">&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#962;</span>) was laced up the
front, and reached to the calves; the <span class="grk" title="kothornos">&#954;&#959;&#952;&#959;&#961;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> (cothurnus) was a
high boot reaching to the middle of the leg, and as worn by tragic
actors had high soles. Slippers (<span class="grk" title="persikai">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;</span>) were adopted from
the East by women; shoes (<span class="grk" title="embades">&#7952;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>) were worn by the poorer
classes. Gloves (<span class="grk" title="cheirides">&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>) were worn by the Persians, but apparently
never by the Greeks unless to protect the hands when
working (<i>Odyssey</i>, xxiv. 230). Hats, which were as a rule worn
only by youths, workmen and slaves, were of circular shape, and
either of some stiff material, as the Boeotian hat observed in
terra-cottas from Tanagra, or of pliant material which could be
bent down at the sides like the <span class="grk" title="petasos">&#960;&#941;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#959;&#962;</span> worn by Hermes and
sometimes even by women. The <span class="grk" title="kausia">&#954;&#945;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>, or Macedonian hat,
seems to have been similar to this. The <span class="grk" title="kyrbasia">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#946;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>, or <span class="grk" title="kidaris">&#954;&#943;&#948;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#962;</span>,
was a high-pointed hat of Persian origin, as was also the <span class="grk" title="tiara">&#964;&#953;&#940;&#961;&#945;</span>,
which served the double purpose of an ornament and a covering
for the head. Workmen wore a close-fitting felt cap (<span class="grk" title="pilos">&#960;&#8150;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>).</p>

<p>iv. <i>Etruscan Costume.</i>&mdash;The female dress of the Etruscans did
not differ in any important respect from that of the Greeks; it
consisted of the <i>chiton</i> and <i>himation</i>, which was in earlier times
usually worn as a shawl, not after the fashion of the Doric <span class="grk" title="peplos">&#960;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>.
Two articles of costume, however, were peculiar to the Etruscans&mdash;the
high conical hat known as the
<i>tutulus</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_25p" id="FnAnchor_25p" href="#Footnote_25p"><span class="sp">25</span></a> and the shoes with turned-up
points (Latin <i>calcei repandi</i>). These
have oriental analogies, and lend support
to the tradition that the Etruscans came
from Asia. Both are represented on
a small bronze figure in the British
Museum (fig. 19). On a celebrated terra-cotta
sarcophagus in the British Museum
of much later date (fig. 20), the female
figure reclining on the lid wears a Greek
chiton of a thin white material, with
short sleeves fastened on the outside of
the arm, by means of buttons and loops;
a <i>himation</i> of dark purple thick stuff
is wrapped round her hips and legs; on
her feet are sandals, consisting of a sole
apparently of leather, and attached to the foot and leg with
leather straps; under the straps are thin socks which do not
cover the toes; she wears a necklace of heavy pendants; her
ears are pierced for ear-rings; her hair is partly gathered
together with a ribbon at the roots behind, and partly hangs
in long tresses before and behind; a flat diadem is bound
round her head a little way back from the brow and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
temples. Purple, pale green and white, richly embroidered, are
favourite colours in the dresses represented on the painted
tombs.</p>

<p>The chief article of male dress was called the tebenna. We are
told by ancient writers that the <i>toga praetexta</i>, with its purple
border (<span class="grk" title="periporphyros têbenna">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#972;&#961;&#966;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#942;&#946;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945;</span>), as worn by Roman magistrates
and priests, had been derived from the Etruscans (Pliny, N.H.
ix. 63, &ldquo;praetextae apud Etruscos originem invenere&rdquo;); and the
famous statue of the orator in Florence (Plate, fig. 22), an
Etruscan work of the 3rd century B.C., represents a man clothed
in this garment, which will be described below. Under the
tebenna, or toga, which was necessary only for public appearance,
the Etruscans wore a short tunic similar to the Greek chiton.
For workmen and others of inferior occupation this appears to
have been the only dress. Youths, when engaged in horsemanship
and other exercises, wore a chlamys round the shoulders,
which, however, was semicircular in cut, and was fastened on
the breast by buttons and a loop, or tied in a knot, whereas the
Greek chlamys was oblong and fastened on the shoulder by a
brooch. On public or festal occasions the Etruscan noble wore,
besides the tebenna, a <i>bulla</i>, or necklace of <i>bullae</i>, and a wreath,
<i>corona Etrusca</i>. The bulla was a circular gold locket containing
a charm of some kind against evil.<a name="FnAnchor_26p" id="FnAnchor_26p" href="#Footnote_26p"><span class="sp">26</span></a> On the later sarcophagi the
male figures wear not only a wreath or <i>corona</i> proper, but also a
garland of flowers hung round the neck. The male head-dress
was the <i>galerus</i>, a hat of leather, said to have been worn by the
Lucumos in early times, or the <i>apex</i>, a pointed hat corresponding
to the <i>tutulus</i> worn by females. The fashion of shoes worn by
Roman senators was said to have been derived from Etruria.
Etruscan shoes were prized both in Greece and in Rome.</p>

</div>

<p>v. <i>Roman Costume.</i>&mdash;We are told that the <i>toga</i>, the national
garment of the Romans, was originally worn both by men and by
women; and though the female dress of the Romans was in
historical times essentially the same as that of the Greeks, young
girls still wore the <i>toga</i> on festal occasions, as we see from the
reliefs of the Ara Pacis Augustae. In early times no undergarment
was worn save a loin-cloth (<i>subligaculum</i>), which seems
to be a survival of early Mediterranean fashions (see above, sect.
<i>Aegean Costume</i>), and candidates for office in historical times
appeared in the <i>toga</i> and <i>subligaculum</i> only. In this period,
however, the <i>tunica</i>, corresponding to the Greek chiton, was
universally worn in ordinary life, and the <i>toga</i> gradually became a
full-dress garment which was only worn over the <i>tunica</i> on
important social occasions; Juvenal (iii. 171) tells us that in a
great part of Italy no one wore the <i>toga</i> except at his burial!</p>

<p>The <i>toga</i> was a piece of woollen cloth in the form of a segment
of a circle,<a name="FnAnchor_27p" id="FnAnchor_27p" href="#Footnote_27p"><span class="sp">27</span></a> the chord of the arc being about three times the
height of the wearer, and the height a little less than one-half
of this length. One end of this garment was thrown over the
left shoulder and allowed to hang down in front; the remainder
was drawn round the body and disposed in various ways. In the
<i>cinctus Gabinus</i>, which was the fashion adopted in early times
when fighting was in prospect, the end of the <i>toga</i> was drawn
tightly round the waist and formed a kind of girdle; this was
retained in certain official functions, such as the opening of the
temple of Janus in historical times.<a name="FnAnchor_28p" id="FnAnchor_28p" href="#Footnote_28p"><span class="sp">28</span></a> In time of peace the <i>toga</i>
was wrapped round the right arm, leaving the hand only free,
much after the fashion of the Greek <i>himation</i>, and thrown over
the left shoulder so as to fall down behind (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roman Art</a></span>,
Plate II., fig. 11, male figure to r.); or, if greater freedom were
desired, it was passed under the right arm-pit. In religious
ceremonies, the magistrate presiding at the sacrifice drew the
back of the toga over his head; see in the same illustration the
priest with veiled head, <i>ritu Gabino</i>, who also wears his <i>toga</i>
with the <i>cinctus Gabinus</i>. Towards the end of the republic
a new fashion was generally adopted. A considerable length
of the toga was allowed to hang from the left shoulder; the
remainder was passed round the body so as to rise like a baldric
(<i>balteus</i>) from the right hip to the left shoulder, being folded over
in front (the fold was called sinus), then brought round the back of
the neck so that the end fell over the right shoulder; the hanging
portion on the left side was drawn up through the <i>sinus</i>, and
bulged out in an <i>umbo</i> (Plate, fig. 24). Later still, this portion,
instead of forming a bundle of folds in the centre, was carefully
folded over and carried up over the left shoulder, and in course
of time these folds were carefully arranged in several thicknesses
resembling boards, <i>tabulae</i>, hence called <i>contabulatio</i> (Plate,
fig. 23). Yet another fashion was that adopted by the flamens,
who passed the right-hand portion of the <i>toga</i> over the right
shoulder and arm and back over the left shoulder, so that it
hung down in a curve over the front of the body; the upper
edge was folded over. The flamens are thus represented on the
Ara Pacis Augustae.</p>

<p>The plain white toga (<i>toga pura</i>) was the ordinary dress of the
citizen, but the <i>toga praetexta</i>, which had a border of purple,
was worn by boys till the age of sixteen, when they assumed
the plain <i>toga virilis</i>, and also by curule magistrates and some
priests. A purple toga with embroidery (<i>toga picta</i>) was worn
together with a gold-embroidered tunic (<i>tunica palmata</i>) by
generals while celebrating a triumph and by magistrates presiding
at games; it represented the traditional dress of the kings
and was adopted by Julius Caesar as a permanent costume.
The emperors wore it on occasions of special importance. The
<i>trabea</i>, which in historical times was worn by the consuls when
opening the temple of Janus, by the <i>equites</i> at their yearly inspection
and on some other occasions, and by the Salii at their
ritual dances, and had (according to tradition) formed the
original costume of the augurs and flamens (who afterwards
adopted the <i>toga praetexta</i>), was apparently a <i>toga</i> smaller in size
than the ordinary civil dress, decorated with scarlet stripes
(<i>trabes</i>). It was fastened with brooches (fibulae) and appears
to have been worn by the <i>equites</i>, e.g. at the funeral ceremony of
Antoninus Pius.</p>

<p>The tunica was precisely like the Greek chiton; that of the
senator had two broad stripes of purple (latus clavus) down the
centre, that of the knight two narrow stripes (angustus clavus).
A woollen undergarment (subucula) was often worn by men;
the women&rsquo;s under-tunic was of linen (indusium). When women
gave up the use of the toga, they adopted the stola, a long tunic
with a border of a darker colour (instita) along the lower edge;
the neck also sometimes had a border (patagium). The tunic with
long sleeves (tunica manicata) was a later fashion. Over this the
ricinium or rica, a shawl covering the head and shoulders, was
worn in early times, and retained by certain priestesses as an
official costume;<a name="FnAnchor_29p" id="FnAnchor_29p" href="#Footnote_29p"><span class="sp">29</span></a> but it gave place to the palla, the equivalent
of the Greek himation, and the dress of the Roman women
henceforward differed in no essential particular from that of
the Greek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
A variety of cloaks were worn by men during inclement
weather; in general they resembled the Greek chlamys, but often
had a hood (<i>cucullus</i>) which could be drawn over the head.
Such were the <i>birrus</i> (so-called from its red colour), <i>abolla</i> and
<i>lacerna</i>. The <i>paenula</i>, which was the garment most commonly
worn, especially by soldiers when engaged on peace duties, was
an oblong piece of cloth with a hole in the centre for the neck;
a hood was usually attached to the back. It survives in the
ritual chasuble of the Western Church. The Greek military
chlamys appears in two forms&mdash;the <i>paludamentum</i> of the
general (e.g. Trajan as represented on the Arch of Constantine,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roman Art</a></span>, Plate III., fig. 16), and the <i>sagum</i> worn by the
common soldier (e.g. by some of the horsemen on the base of the
Antonine column, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roman Art</a></span>, Plate V., fig. 21). When the
toga went out of use as an article of everyday wear, the <i>pallium</i>,
i.e. the Greek <i>himation</i>, was at first worn only by Romans
addicted to Greek fashions, but from the time of Tiberius, who
wore it in daily life, its use became general. Long robes bearing
Greek names (<i>synthesis, syrma</i>, &amp;c.) were worn at dinner-parties.</p>

<p>The Romans often wore sandals (<i>soleae</i>) or light shoes (<i>socci</i>),
but in full dress (i.e. with the toga) it was necessary to wear the
<i>calceus</i>, which had various forms by which classes were distinguished,
e.g. the <i>calceus patricius, mulleus</i> (of red leather) and
<i>senatorius</i> (of black leather). This was a shoe with slits at the
sides and straps knotted in front; its forms may be seen on the
relief from the Ara Pacis. The senators&rsquo; <i>calceus</i> had four such
straps (<i>quattuor corrigiae</i>), which were wound round the ankle
(cf. the <i>flamen</i> on the Ara Pacis), and was also adorned with an
ivory crescent (<i>lunula</i>). A leathern tongue (<i>lingula</i>) is often
seen to project from beneath the straps. The soldier&rsquo;s boot
(<i>caliga</i>, from which the emperor Gaius derived his nickname,
Caligula) was in reality a heavy hobnailed sandal with a number
of straps wound round the ankle and lower leg. A high hunting
boot was called <i>compagus</i>. Women at times wore the <i>calceus</i>,
but are generally represented in art with soft shoes or sandals.</p>

<p>Hats were seldom worn except by those who affected Greek
fashions, but the close-fitting leather <i>pileus</i> seems to have been an
article of early wear in Italy, since its use survived in the ceremony
of manumission, and the head-dress of the pontifices and flamines
(cf. the relief of the Ara Pacis already referred to) consisted in such
a cap (<i>galerus</i>) with an apex, or <i>spike</i>, of olive wood inserted in
the crown.</p>

<p>For personal ornament finger-rings of great variety in the
material and design were worn by men, sometimes to the extent
of one or more on each finger, many persons possessing small
cabinets of them. But at first the Roman citizen wore only an
iron signet ring, and this continued to be used at marriages. The
<i>jus annuli aurei</i>, or right of wearing a gold ring, originally a
military distinction, became a senatorial privilege, which was
afterwards extended to the knights and gradually to other
classes. Women&rsquo;s ornaments consisted of brooches (<i>fibulae</i>),
bracelets (<i>armillae</i>), armlets (<i>armillae, bracchialia</i>), ear-rings
(<i>inaures</i>), necklaces (<i>monilia</i>), wreaths (<i>coronae</i>) and hair-pins
(<i>crinales</i>). The tore (<i>torques</i>), or cord of gold worn round the
neck, was introduced from Gaul. A profusion of precious stones,
and absence of skill or refinement in workmanship, distinguish
Roman from Greek or Etruscan jewelry; but in the character of
the designs there is no real difference.</p>

<p>i. <i>Pre-Roman and Roman Britain.</i>&mdash;Men who had found
better clothing than the skins of beasts were in Britain when
Caesar landed. Little as we know of England before the English,
we have at least the knowledge that Britons, other than the
poorer and wilder sort of the north and the fens, wore cloaks and
hats, sleeved coats whose skirts were cut above the knee and
loose trousers after the fashion of the Gauls. They were not an
armoured race, for they would commonly fight naked to the waist,
dreadful with tattooing and woad staining, but Pliny describes
their close-woven felts as all but sword-proof. Dyers as well
as weavers, their cloaks, squares of cloth like a Highland plaid,
were of black or blue, rough on the one side, while coats and
trousers were bright coloured, striped and checkered, red being
the favourite hue. For ornament the British chiefs wore golden
torques about their necks and golden arm-rings with brooches
and pins of metal or ivory, beads of brass, of jet and amber from
their own coasts, and of glass bought of the Southern merchants.
Their women had gowns to the ankle, with shorter tunics above
them. The Druid bards had their vestments of blue, while the
star-gazers and leeches went in green.</p>

<p>Agricola&rsquo;s Romanizing work must have made great changes
in dress as in policy. The British chief with the Latin tongue
in his mouth, living in a Roman villa and taking his bath as did
the Romans, wore the white woollen toga and the linen tunic,
his wife having the stole, the pall and the veil.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Old English Dress.</i>&mdash;The skill of their artists gives us many
accurate pictures of the dress of the English before the Norman
Conquest, the simple dress of a nation whose men
fight, hunt and plough. The man&rsquo;s chief garment is
<span class="sidenote">Before the Conquest.</span>
a sleeved tunic hanging to the knee, generally open
at the side from hip to hem and in front from the throat to the
breast. Sleeves cut loosely above the elbow are close at the
forearm. The legs are in hose like a Highlander&rsquo;s or in long
breeches bandaged or cross-gartered below the knee. A short
mantle to the calf is brooched at the shoulder or breast (fig. 25).
There are long gowns and toga-like cloaks, but these as a rule
seem garments for the old man of rank. In the open air the cloak
is often pulled over the head, for hats and caps are rare, the
Phrygian bonnet being the commonest form. Girdles of folded
cloth gather the loose tunic at the waist. Most paintings show
the ankle shoe as black, cut with a pointed tab before and behind,
the soles being sometimes of wood like the sole of the Lancashire
clog of our own days. A nobleman will have his shoes embroidered
with silks or coloured yarns, and the like decoration for the hem
and collar of his tunic. Poor men wear little but the tunic,
often going barelegged, although the hinds in the well-known
pictures of the twelve months have shoes, and the shepherd as
he watches his flock covers himself with a cloak. In every graveyard
of the old English we find the brooches, armlets, rings and
pins of a people loving jewelry. Women wore a long gown
covering the feet, the loose sleeves sometimes hanging over the
hands to the knee. Over this there is often a shorter tunic with
short sleeves. Their mantles were short or long, the hood or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
head rail wrapped round the chin (fig. 26). In broidery and
ornament the women&rsquo;s dress matched that of the men. The
Danes, warriors of the sea, soon took the English habit, becoming
notable for their many changes of gay clothing.</p>

<p>The Norman Conquest is marked by no great change in English
clothing, the conquerors inclining towards the island fashions,
as we may see by the fact that they gave up their
curious habit of shaving the back of the head. But
<span class="sidenote">The Normans.</span>
with the reign of the second William came the taste
for the luxury of clothing and that taste for flowing hair and shoes
with sharp points which is lamented by William of Malmesbury.
In this reign we have the story of the Red King refusing to put
on boots that cost but three shillings&mdash;the price of an ox&mdash;and
wearing the same gladly when his chamberlain told him that they
were a new pair worth a mark. Even more than the fashion
of long cloaks and trailing gowns whose sleeves hang far below
the hands, the fantastic boot and shoe toes bring the curses of
the clergy and the moralizings of chroniclers. Fulk Rechin of
Anjou is said by Orderic to have invented such gear to hide the
monstrous bunions upon his toes, but a worthless Robert, a
hanger-on of the court of William II., distinguishes himself and
gains the surname of Cornard by stuffing his shoe tips with tow
and twisting them like the horns of the ram.</p>

<p>There are many illuminations which give us in plenty the
details of all costumes of the 12th century. Thus the devil in a
well-known MS. wears the gown of a lady of rank, the
bodice tightly laced, the hanging sleeve knotted to
<span class="sidenote">12th and 13th centuries.</span>
keep it out of the mud. A MS. at Corpus Christi
College, Oxford, shows in a picture of the vision of
Henry I. that the men who reap and dig are simply clad in loose
skirted tunics with close sleeves, that they have hats with
brims, and cloaks caught by a brooch at the shoulder. Hats
and caps are common in all classes and take many shapes&mdash;the
Phrygian cap, the flat bonnet, the brimmed hat and the skull-cap.</p>

<p>With the coming of the house of Anjou English dress clears
itself of the more fantastic features of an earlier generation.
Henry II. brought in the short Angevin mantle and from it had
his name of Curtmantle, but it was not a mastering fashion and
the long cloak holds its own. Rich stuffs, cloth of gold or silk
woven with gold, webs of damask wrought with stripes or rays
and figured with patterns are brought in from the ports. Rare
furs are eagerly sought. But the simplicity of line is remarkable.
The drawings made for Matthew Paris&rsquo;s lives of the two Offas
show people of all ranks clad without a trace of the tailor&rsquo;s
fantasy. Kings and lords, churchmen
and men of substance go in
long gowns to the feet, the great
folk having an orphrey or band of
embroidery at the somewhat low-cut
neck (fig. 27). Some of the
sleeves have wide ends cut off at
the mid-forearm, showing the tight
sleeve of a shirt or smock below.
Fashion, however, tends to lengthen
sleeves to a tight wrist, the upper
halves being cut wide and loose with
the large armholes characteristic of
most ancient tailoring. Over this
gown is worn an ample cloak
fastened at the neck with a brooch
or clasp, and sometimes fitted with
a hood. The dress of the common
folk and of men of rank when
actively employed is a tunic which is but the gown shortened
to the knee, a short cloak to the knee being worn with
it (fig. 28). Belts and girdles are narrow and plain, the thongs
without enrichment, showing no beginnings of the rich buckles
and heavy bosses of a later fashion. Shoes and low-cut boots
are slightly pointed, and hats, caps, hoods and coifs of many
types cover the head. The women are like to the men in their
long gown, but the head is wrapped in a coverchef hanging
over the shoulder and bound with a fillet round the brow.
Gloves are common in this age; &ldquo;scraps of the cloth or the
skin,&rdquo; says a poet, &ldquo;do not want for a use: of them gloves
are made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the court of Edward II., son of a king who went simply
clad, Piers Gaveston and his like began to set the fashions for a
century which to the curious antiquary is a garden
of delights. For the history of the 14th-century
<span class="sidenote">14th century.</span>
clothing illuminations are supplemented by a number
of effigies upon which the carver has wrought out the last details,
by monumental brasses, and by contemporary literature and
records (fig. 29). Garments take many shapes; sleeves, skirts
and head-dresses run through many fashions; while personal
ornaments are rich and beautiful to a degree never yet surpassed.
With the beginning of the century there is seen a tendency to
shorten the long gown, which
had been the best wear of a
man of good estate, to a more
convenient length, although
the knees are still well covered.
Loose sleeves falling below
the elbow leave to view the
sleeve of an under-garment,
buttoned tightly to the arm.
In winter time a man&rsquo;s gown
will have long sleeves that
cover the hands when the arms
are at length. The full cloak,
although still found, is somewhat
rare among a people
that has, perhaps, learned
to wear more clothes and
warmer upon the body.
Hoods are worn in many fashions, to be cast back upon the
shoulders like a monk&rsquo;s cowl, the part at the back of the head
being drawn out into a &ldquo;liripipe&rdquo; long enough at times, when
the hood is drawn up, to be knotted round the brow turban-fashion
(fig. 30). Long hose are drawn up the legs to join the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
short breech, and the toes of the ankle-shoes are pointed so long
that holy men see visions of little devils using them as chariots.
The women love trailing gowns. They have under-skirts and
loose over-garments, sometimes sleeveless. Their hair at least
would not shock those earlier prelates who cursed the long
plaits, for it is caught up in a caul or braided at the sides of the
head. In the second half of the century men of rank borrow
from Germany the fashion of the <i>cote-hardie</i>. In its plainest
form this short tunic, covering the fork of the leg, is cut closely
to the body and arms (fig. 31). Sometimes the sleeve ends at
the elbow and then another streamer is added to the one which
falls from the hood, a strip of stuff continuing the elbow-sleeve
as low as the coat edge. This strip and the hem of the skirt are
often &ldquo;slittered&rdquo; with fanciful jags, a fashion which soon draws
down the satirist&rsquo;s anger. Parti-coloured garments were an
added offence; a gentleman would have his coat parted down
the middle in red and white, with hose of white and red to match.
Men and women of rank wear a twisted garland of rich stuff,
crown-wise on the head, set with pearls and precious stones,
a fashion which is followed on the great helm of the knights,
being the &ldquo;wreath&rdquo; or &ldquo;torce&rdquo; of heraldry. The dames of
such as wear the <i>cote-hardie</i> imitate its tightness in the sleeves
and bodices of their long gown. A curious fashion which now
begins is the sleeveless upper gown whose sides are cut away
in curved sweeps from the shoulder to below the waist, the edges
of the opening being deeply furred. The strange head-dress with
a steeple-horn draped with lawn kerchiefs makes its appearance
to shock the moralists. Although it was probably a rare sight
in this century, the horn could easily fulfil its mission of drawing
notice to all its wearers.</p>

<p>Of the <i>cote-hardie</i> it might at least be said that it was the
symbol of a knightly age in arms, the garment of a man who
must have hand and limbs free, and, save for its sleeves, it faithfully
copied the coat-armour of the armed knight. The softer
days of Richard II. are remarkable for a dress which has also
its significance, men of high rank taking to themselves gowns
of such fulness that the satirists may be justified who declare
that men so clad may be hardly known from women. The close
collar of these gowns rises high as the neckcloth of a French
<i>incroyable</i>, the upper edge turned slightly over and jagged. The
full skirts sweep on the ground, which is touched by the last jags
of the vast sleeves, whose openings, wide as a woman&rsquo;s skirts,
are dagged like the edges of vine or oak leaves. &ldquo;And but if
the slevis,&rdquo; says the satirist, &ldquo;slide on the erthe, thei wolle be
wroth as the wynde.&rdquo; Sometimes this gown is slit at the sides
that the gallant may the better show his coloured hose and tips
of shoes that pike out two feet from heel to toe. When not
wearing the gown such a lord would have a high-necked coat,
shorter even than the <i>cote-hardie</i>, but looser in the skirt, the
sleeves ending full and loose with dagged edges turned over at
the cuff. Hats are more commonly worn in this century, and
in its latter half take many shapes, a notable one being that of a
shortened sugar-loaf or thimble with a brim turned up, either
all round, or, more frequently, behind or before. The long
shoes, as their name of <i>crackowes</i> or <i>poleynes</i> implies, were a
fashion which, by repute, came from Poland, a land ruled by
the grandfather of Richard&rsquo;s first queen. When medieval
fashions were past, they were remembered as a type of the old
time, and a certain French <i>conteur</i> begins a tale of old days, not
with <i>jadis</i>, but with &ldquo;In the time when they wore poleynes.&rdquo;
Even parish priests, whose preaching should &ldquo;dryve out the
daggis and alle the Duche cotis,&rdquo; went, in this age of fine
apparel, gaily clad in gowns of scarlet and green, &ldquo;shape of the
newe,&rdquo; in &ldquo;cutted clothes&rdquo; with &ldquo;long pikes on her shone.&rdquo;
More than this, they made scandal by ruffling with weapons&mdash;&ldquo;bucklers
brode and sweardes long, bandrike with baselardes
kene.&rdquo; The skill of goldsmiths and craftsmen decorates all
the appurtenances of the dress of this 14th century. Buttons,
which appear in the first Edward&rsquo;s time as a scandalous ornament
on men of low degree, have now become common, and,
cunningly wrought, are used as much for <i>queintise</i> as for service.
A close row of them will run from wrist to elbow of tight sleeve.
A row of buttons goes from the neck of a woman&rsquo;s gown, and
the <i>cote-hardie</i> may be fastened down the front with a dozen and
a half of rich buttons. A purse or gipciere hung by a ring to the
girdle gives more room for ornament in the silver or brass bar
on which the bag depends. Above all the girdle, which&mdash;in
harness or in silk&mdash;rich men wear broad and bossed with jewels
across the thigh below the waist, makes work for the jeweller&rsquo;s
craftsman. Such a girdle is for great folk alone; but lesser men,
wearing a strap about their waists, will yet have a handsome
buckle and a fanciful pendant of metal guarding the loose end
of the strap.</p>

<p>However fantastic the fashions of this or any other ages, folk
of the middling sort will avoid the extremes. From the Knight
to the Reve, no man of Chaucer&rsquo;s company calls to us by the
fantasy of his clothing. The Knight himself rides in his fustian
<i>gipoun</i>, the grime of his habergeon upon it, although his son&rsquo;s
short gown, the gayest garment at the Tabard, had long and
wide sleeves and is embroidered with flowers like any mead. A
coat and hood of green
mark the Yeoman, who
has a silver Christopher
brooch for ornament.
The Merchant is in
motley stuff, his beaver
hat from Flanders and
his clasped boots taking
Chaucer&rsquo;s eye, as do the
<i>anlas</i> and silken <i>gipser</i>
which hang at the rich
Franklin&rsquo;s belt. As for
the London burgesses,
their knife-chapes, girdles
and pouches are in clean
silver. The Shipman
wears his knife in a lanyard
about his neck, as
his fellows do to this
day, and his coat is of
coarse falding to the knee. The Wife of Bath has the wimple
below her broad hat and rides in a foot mantle about her hips.
Poorer men&rsquo;s dress is on the Reve and the Ploughman, the one
in a long <i>surcote</i> of sky-blue and the other in the <i>tabard</i> which
we may recognize as that smock-frock which goes down the ages
with little change.</p>

<p>In the 15th century the middle ages run out. Fashions in
this period become, if not more fantastic, more various. Its
earlier years see men of rank still inclined to the rich
modes of the last age: Harry of Monmouth, drawn
<span class="sidenote">15th century.</span>
about 1410 by an artist who shows him as Occleve&rsquo;s
patron, wears a blue gown which might have passed muster at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
court of Richard II. for its trailing skirts and its long sleeves,
their slittered edges turned back (fig. 32). A strange fancy at this
time was the hanging of silver bells on the dress. One William
Staunton, in 1409, seeing in a vision at St Patrick&rsquo;s Purgatory the
fate of earth&rsquo;s proud ones, is exact to note that in the place of
torment the jags in men&rsquo;s clothes turn to adders, that women&rsquo;s
trailing skirts are burnt over their heads, and that those men
whose garments are overset with silver gingles and bells have
burning nails of fire driven through each gingle. As for the
chaplets of gold, of pearls and precious stones, they turn into
nails of iron on which the fiends hammer.</p>

<p>The common habit of a well-clad man in the first half of this
century is a loose tunic, lined with fur, or edged with fur at neck,
wrist and skirt. At first the sleeves are long and bag-like, like to
the Richard II. sleeve but drawn in to the wrist, where early
examples are fastened with a button. A shorter tunic is worn
below, whose tight sleeves are seen beyond the furred edge of the
upper garment, mittens being sometimes attached to them.
Over the shoulders the hood is thrown, or, in foul weather, a hood
and cloak. The gown is girdled at the waist with a girdle from
which hangs the anelace or baselard (fig. 34). Shoes are pointed.
Hats and caps are seen in many shapes, but the most remarkable
is the developed form of that head-dress which the 14th-century
man seems to have achieved by putting his pate into the face-hole
of his hood and twisting its liripipe round his brows. In the
15th century the effect is produced with a thick, turban-like roll
of stuff from the top of which hung down on one side folds of
cloth coming nigh to the
shoulder, and on the other
the liripipe broadened and
lengthened to 4 or 5 ft. of a
narrower folded cloth. As
the century advances the
bagpipe sleeves shrink in
size and the tunic skirts are
shortened (fig. 35). The
old habit of going armed
with anelace or baselard
dies away in spite of
troublous times. In the
middle of the century the
tunic is often no longer
than a modern frock-coat,
its sleeves little wider than those of a modern overcoat. Dress,
indeed, becomes at this time convenient and attractive to our
modern eyes. The last quarter of the century sees a new and
important change. The tunic or gown, which was the garment
of ceremony answering at once to our dress coats and frock
coats, runs down to the feet. An act of 1463 ordered that
coats should at least cover the buttocks, but fashion achieved
suddenly what law failed to enforce. Men who had polled their
hair short allowed it to grow and hang over the shoulders. The
belt carries the purse or gipciere more commonly, although
weapons are rarely seen, and it is notable that, as the Reformation
approaches, the fashion of wearing a large &ldquo;pair of beads&rdquo;
in the belt becomes a very common one. Last of all, the shoes
change their shape. The reign
of Edward IV. had seen the
pointed toes as iniquitously
long as ever the 14th century
saw them. Even the long
riding boot has the curving
point, although otherwise much
resembling the jack-boot of the
18th century. But after Bosworth
Field the soles broaden,
the point shrinks back and
then disappears, and the footprint
becomes shovel-shaped.</p>

<p>Women&rsquo;s dress in the 15th
century often follows the man&rsquo;s
fashion of the furred gown, the
skirts being lengthened for all
difference. But the close-bodied
and close-sleeved gown, with
skirts broadening into many
folds below the hips, is often
seen with the long and plain
cloak drawn with a cord at the breast, widows wearing this
dress with the <i>barbe</i>, a crimped cloth of linen drawn up under
the chin and ears and covering the collar-bone. With the
barbe went the kerchief, draping head and shoulders. The
bossed cauls of the earlier head-dress, drawn high on either
side of the head until face and head-dress took the shape of a
heart, are characteristic of the age (fig. 36). In some cases the
cauls are drawn out at the sides to the form of a pair of bulls&rsquo;
horns or of a mitre set sideways. In the time of Edward IV. we
have a popular head-dress to which has been given the name of
the butterfly. The hair in its caul is pulled backward, and wires
set in it allow the ends of a cambric veil to float behind like the
wings of a butterfly settled on a flower.</p>


<p>The new England of the 16th century breaks with the past in
most of its fashions. Never again does an Englishman return to
the piked shoes. High fashion under Henry VIII. is all
for broad toes, so broad that the sumptuary laws, from
<span class="sidenote">The 16th century.</span>
banning long toes, swing about to condemn excess in
the new guise. Under Henry VII. the medieval influence is still
strong in the body-clothing. A bravely dressed man will go in
long hose, cut close to the
body, and a short vest under
which the shirt is seen at
waist and wrist. Over this he
will wear the open gown, lined
with fur, and cut short as a
jacket but having the sleeves
hanging below the knee. Such
sleeves are commonly slashed
open at the sides to allow the
forearm to pass through.
Shorter false sleeves of this
pattern had become popular
in the age of Edward IV.
Graver men will wear, in place
of this short gown, a long one
dropping to the broad shoe-toes,
the sleeves wide-mouthed
(fig. 37). Sometimes it hangs
loosely; sometimes it has the
girdle with purse and beads. Notaries and scriveners add
to the girdle a penner, or pen-case, and a stoppered ink-bottle.
Wide hats are found, crowned with huge plumes of
feathers, but the characteristic headgear is that made familiar by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
portraits of Henry VII., a low-crowned cap whose upturned brim
is nicked at one side. A few sober men wear coats differing little
from the short gown of forty years before. Among ladies the
butterfly head-dress and the steeple cap passed out of fashion,
and a grave headgear comes in which has been compared with a
dog-kennel, a hood-cap thrown over head and shoulders, the
front being edged with a broad band which was often enriched
with needlework, the ends falling in lappets to the breast.
This band is stiffened until the face looks out as from the open
gable-end of a house. The gown is simple in form, close-fitting
to the body, the cuffs turned up with fur and the skirts long. A
girdle is worn loosely drawn below the waist, its long strap
letting the metal pendant fall nearly to the feet. Long cloaks,
plainly cut, are gathered at the neck with a pair of long cords,
like tasselled bell-pulls. While Henry VIII. is spending his
father&rsquo;s hoards we have a splendid court, gallantly dressed in new
fashions. His own broad figure, in cloth of gold, velvet and
damask, plaits, puffs and slashes, stiff with jewels, is well known
through scores of portraits, and may stand for the high-water
mark of the modes of his age. The Hampton Court picture of the
earl of Surrey is characteristic of a
great lord&rsquo;s dress of a somewhat
soberer style (see fig. 38). The king,
proud of his own broad shoulders,
set the fashion to accent this
breadth, and it will be seen that
the earl&rsquo;s figure, leaving out the
head and hose, all but fills a perfect
square. Such men have the air of
playing-card knaves. Surrey&rsquo;s cap
is flat, with a rich brooch and a
small side-feather. His short
doublet of the new style is open in
front to show a white shirt covered
with black embroidery whose ruffles
cover his wrists. His over-garment
or jerkin has vast sleeves, rounded,
puffed and slashed. Under the
doublet are seen wide trunk-breeches.
He goes all in scarlet,
even to the shoes, which are of
moderate size. The girdle carries
a sword with the new guard and a
dagger of the Renascence art, graced
with a vast tassel. All is in the
new fashion, nothing recalling the earlier century save the
hose and the immodest <i>braguette</i> which, seen in the latter
half of the fourteen-hundreds, is defiantly displayed in the
dress and armour of this age of Henry VIII. Even the hair
follows the new French mode and is cropped close. Other
fashionable suits of the time give us the tight doublets, loose
upper sleeves and trunk hose as a mass of small slashes and puffs,
a fashion which came in from the Germans and Switzers whom
Henry saw in the imperial service. Such clothing goes with the
shoes whose broad toes are slashed with silk, and the wide and
flat caps with slashed edges, bushed with feathers, which headgear
was often allowed to hang upon the shoulders by a pair of
knotted bonnet-strings, while a skull-cap covered the head. With
all this fantasy the dress of simpler folk has little concern, and
a man in a plain, short-skirted doublet, with a flat cap, trunk
breeches, long hose and plain shoes, has nothing grotesque or
unserviceable in his attire. The new sumptuary laws, which
were not allowed to become a dead letter, had their influence in
restraining middle-class extravagance. No man under a knight&rsquo;s
degree was to wear a neck-chain of gold or gilded, or a &ldquo;garded or
pinched shirte.&rdquo; Brooches of goldsmith&rsquo;s work were for none
below a gentleman. Women whose husbands could not afford to
maintain a light horse for the king&rsquo;s service had no business with
gowns or petticoats of silk, chains of gold, French hoods, or bonnets
of velvet. This French hood is the small bonnet, two of whose
many forms may be seen in the best-known portraits of Mary of
England and Mary, queen of Scots&mdash;a cap stiffened with wires.
With its introduction the fashionable skirt began to lose its
graceful folds and to spread stiffly outward in straight lines from
the tight-laced waist, the front being open to show a petticoat as
stiff and enriched as the skirt. The neck of the gown, cut low and
square, showed the <i>partlet</i> of fine linen pleated to the neck. In
the days of Edward VI. and Queen Mary the dress of most men
and women loses the fantastic detail of the earlier Tudor age.
In the dress of both sexes the joining of the sleeve to the shoulder
has, as a rule, that large puff which stage dressmakers bestow so
lavishly upon all old English costumes, but otherwise the woman&rsquo;s
gown and hood and the man&rsquo;s doublet, jerkin and trunk hose are
plain enough, even the shoes losing all the fanciful width. Mary,
indeed, added to the statute book more stringent laws against
display of rich apparel, laws that would fine even a gentleman of
under £20 a year if silk were found in his cap or shoe. Small
ruffs, however, begin to appear at the neck, and most wrists are
ruffled. The ruff, which began simply enough in the first half of
this century as a little cambric collar with a goffered edge, is for
all of us the distinguishing note of Elizabethan dress. It grew
wide and flapping, therefore it was stiffened upon wires and spread
from a concealed frame, row on row of ruffs being added one above
the other until the wearer, man or woman, seemed to carry the
head in a cambric charger. Starch, cursed as a devilish liquor by
the new Puritan, gave it help, and English dress acquired a
deformity which can only be compared with the great farthingale
or with the last follies of the wig. The skirt of a woman of fashion,
which had already begun to jut from the waist, was drawn out
before the end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign at right angles from the waist
until the dame had that air of standing within a great drum
which Sir Roger de Coverley remarked in the portrait of an
ancestress. Elizabeth herself, long-waisted and of meagre body,
set the fashions of her court, other women pinching their waists
into the long and straight stomacher ending in a peak before.
She herself followed her father&rsquo;s taste in ornament, and on great
days was set about like the Madonna of a popular shrine with
decorations of all kinds, patterns in pearl, quiltings, slashings,
puffings and broidery, tassels and rich buttons. Among men the
important change is the disappearance of the last of the long hose,
all men taking to trunk-hose and nether-stocks or stockings,
while their doublets tend to follow the same long-waisted fashion
as the bodices of the women, whose doublets and jerkins,
buttoned up the breast, bring the Puritan satirists against them.
Of these satirists Philip Stubbes is the best-known, his <i>Anatomie
of Abuses</i>, published in 1583, being a very wardrobe of Elizabethan
fashions, although false or dyed hair, the ruff and its starch, and
the ear-rings worn by some women and many men draw his
hottest anger. William Harrison sings on a like note about
the same time, declaiming especially against the mutability
of fashion, declaring that the imported Spanish, French and
German guises made it easier to inveigh against such enormities
than to describe the English attire with any certainty. For him
women were become men, and men transformed into monsters.
&ldquo;Neither was it ever merrier with England than when an Englishman
was known abroad by his own cloth and contented himself
at home with his fine carsey hosen and a mean slop; his coat,
gown and cloak of brown, blue or puke, with some pretty
furniture of velvet or fur and a doublet of sad tawny or black
velvet or other comely silk, without such cuts and garish colours
as are worn in these days, and never brought in but by the
consent of the French, who think themselves the gayest men
when they have most diversities of jags and change of colours
about them.&rdquo; He adds that &ldquo;certes of all estates our merchants
do least alter their attire ... for albeit that which they wear
be very fine and costly, yet in form and colour it representeth
a great piece of the ancient gravity appertaining to citizens
and burgesses.&rdquo; But as for the &ldquo;younger sort&rdquo; of citizens&rsquo;
wives, Harrison finds in their attire &ldquo;all kind of curiosity ... in
far greater measure than in women of a higher calling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coming of King James is not marked by any sudden change
of attire, most of the Elizabethan fashions running on into his
reign. The tight doublet has stiff wings at the shoulders, close
sleeves and short skirt. The many fashions of breeches are still
<span class="sidenote">17th century.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
popular, most of them padded or stuffed. There are trunk hose
that have the air of petticoats rolled inward half way up the
thigh. There is the &ldquo;great round abominable breech,&rdquo;
pegtop shaped from below the knee to waist, as it
appears in the well-known print of James himself with
hawk on fist. Among women of fashion obtained a remarkable
mode of exposing the breast, when the ruff and bodice were cut
away; and the wheel fardingale was still worn, an order against
it in 1613 rather increasing than diminishing its size. But
simpler fashions were setting in, and with the reign of Charles I.
the extravagances of padding and slashing disappear. The ruff
gives place at last to the falling band, a wide collar of lace or
plain linen. The belt or girdle ceases to be common wear, save
for those who hang a sword from it. Parties in the state come to
be known by their dress, and we have the Puritan, his crop head
covered by a wide-brimmed, high-crowned felt, without hatband
or feather, and his plain falling band over a staidly-cut coat.
Beside him we set the cavalier, lace
at his band edge, wrist and wide boot
tops. His hat is feathered, his
doublet lets the fine cambric of the
shirt be seen at the waist, his short
breeches are fringed with points or
tags. His long hair has one lock
brought over the left shoulder to be
marked as a lovelock by a ribbon at
the end. But the clothing of this age
has been illustrated by Van Dyck
and by a hundred other portrait
painters, who as illustrators of
costume take the place of the monumental
sculptors, then less commonly
called on for an effigy in the habit of
life. And the time of the Commonwealth
passes without notable change.
Those who were in power favoured a
sober habit, although we find General
Harrison in scarlet and clinquant
matching with Colonel Hutchinson
in courtly apparel, and before the Restoration the tract-writers
find matter of condemnation, especially in the items of patches,
hair-powder and face paints.</p>

<p>So far as the court was concerned, King Charles II. brought in
the extravagant fashions of the courtiers of Louis XIV. The
short-waisted doublets with loose sleeves slashed open at the
sides, the short and wide petticoat breeches, their lining lower
than the petticoat edge and tied below the knee, and the hose
whose tops bagged over the garter, were in England before King
Charles returned. He added to the breeches the rows of looped
ribbons, gave falling ruffles
to the knees of the hose and
many feathers to the hat.
The long, narrow-bladed
rapier hung in a broad, embroidered
belt, passed over
the right shoulder, and the
high-heeled shoes and knots
of ribbons. Lely painted the
women of this court in a
studied negligence, but many
pictures show us the loose
sleeves turned up to the elbow
with bows of ribbon, the close
bodice ending in a loose gown
worn over a full skirted petticoat,
a wide collar covering
the shoulders.</p>

<p>Pepys is our chief authority
for the remarkable resolution
of Charles to change the
fashion of his dress to one
which he would never alter,
a decision which the king communicated
to his council in
October 1666. On the 15th
of that month the diarist
noted that &ldquo;this day the king begins to put on his vest, and I
did see several persons of the House of Lords and Commons
too, great courtiers, who are in it; being a long cassocke close
to the body, of black cloth and pinked with white silk under it,
and a coat over it, and the legs ruffled with black riband like
a pigeon&rsquo;s leg ... a very fine and handsome garment.&rdquo; Rugge&rsquo;s
diary records the same change to &ldquo;a close coat of cloth pinkt,
with a white taffety under the cutts. This in length reached the
calf of the leg, and upon that a sercoatt cutt at the breast,
which hung loose and shorter than the vest six inches. The
breeches the Spanish cut, and buskins, some of cloth, some of
leather, but of the same colour as the vest or garment.&rdquo; Says
Evelyn, &ldquo;a comely and manly habit, too good to hold.&rdquo; Later
in the same month Pepys saw the court &ldquo;all full of vests, only
my Lord St Albans not pinked, but plain black; and they say
the king says the pinking upon whites makes them look too much
like magpies, and therefore hath bespoke one of plain velvet.&rdquo;
The change, although the court was fickle, is of the first importance
in the history of costume, for we have here the coat and waistcoat
in a form from which our own coats and waistcoats derive
without a break. Another important change affects dress for
a century and a half. Just as costume begins to take the modern
path we have the wig or peruke, strangest of all the fantasies
of fashion, introduced as the wear for all men of standing. Pepys,
the son of a tailor and a man with a shy affection for fine clothing,
may again here be quoted. On a Sunday in February 1661 he
&ldquo;began to go forth in my coat and sword, as the manner now
among gentlemen is.&rdquo; In November 1663 he takes another step
with fashion, going to the periwig-maker to have his hair cut
off and to put on his first periwig, for which he paid 3<span class="sp">l</span>, another
to be made up of the hair with which he had parted. The next
day he wore the periwig to his office, and &ldquo;no great matter was
made of it.&rdquo; Two days later my Lord Sandwich &ldquo;wondered at
first to see me in my peruque,&rdquo; but even in church Pepys found
that he drew little attention in the new guise. The same month
the duke of York announced that he would wear the periwig,
&ldquo;and they say the king also will.&rdquo; Thus began this costly and
inconvenient mode. At home and at their ease men commonly
replaced the wig with a soft silk or velvet &ldquo;night-cap,&rdquo; and the
coat with a &ldquo;morning gown&rdquo; like our modern dressing gown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
Powder, which had been dusted about the hair by a few courtiers
and fashionable folk since the reign of Elizabeth, was used by
most wearers of the wig. Hair &ldquo;dressed with a powder&rdquo; was
often seen in London under the Commonwealth, and now the
great periwig brought powder into frequent use.</p>

the Crowning of James II.</td></tr></table>

<p>Before the end of the 17th century the periwig reached its
greatest height and breadth, the curls of a fine gentleman
towering in a mass above the brow and
flowing far down over the shoulders or
nigh to the waist. Guardsmen wore
them tossing over their corslets,
although a smaller variety, the campaign
wig, had been introduced for
war or travel. Many portraits of this
age show its locks contrasting strangely
with the soldier&rsquo;s steel breastplate
and pauldrons, but it must be remembered
that martial gentlemen
would often choose to be painted in
armour although such harness was
disappearing from actual use.</p>

<p>Under James II. the coat adopted
in the late reign was firmly established
as the principal garment of a well-dressed
man. Gowns remained but
to make a ceremonial dress for
the great officers of state, for the
judges and the London liverymen,
for such, indeed, as those who wear
them in our own days. As for
&ldquo;the comely cloak, altogether used in the beginning of my
time,&rdquo; Randle Holme notes that it was &ldquo;now scarce used but
by old and grave persons.&rdquo; The coat was sometimes buttoned
down the front but was more often thrown open to display the
waistcoat, a lesser coat with skirts. The great turned over cuffs
were now below the elbow, although there was good space for
the display of the ruffle, and at the neck was the large cravat
with laced ends. After the battle of Steinkirk, in 1692, to which
the young French nobles hastened with disarranged neckcloths,
the cravat was sometimes worn twisted, the ends passed through
a ring, although the word Steinkirk was in later years often
carelessly given to the neckcloth worn in any style. For
riding, the big jack-boot of earlier days, with spurs and broad
spur-leathers, remained in fashion, although the bell-shaped
tops were turned up and not down. Boots, however, were
riding-gear. Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador to James I.,
had laughed over the citizens of London &ldquo;all booted and ready
to go out of town,&rdquo; but this custom died away, and a man in
boots showed that he was for the road. William III.&rsquo;s grave
court was not one in which new fashions flourished, but it is
remarkable that feminine modes take curious variety before
the century end. Long-waisted and straitly cut stays were worn,
the gown sleeve is short as the coat-sleeve of a Charles II. courtier.
The gown itself has the skirts gathered to show the petticoat,
and small aprons fringed with lace are often seen. The simple
head-dresses of the Restoration are changed for caps with long
lace lappets, or for a cap whose top-knot or commode stood up
stiff and fan-shaped like a section cut out of an old ruff. When
no commode was worn, a loose hood, thrown gracefully over the
head and gathered at the shoulders, sometimes took its place.
As a riding or walking dress, ladies of quality often wore coats,
waistcoats, hats and cravats, not to be distinguished from those
of their lords.</p>

<p>For a distinguishing note of the 18th century, we may take
the three-cornered cocked hat. Even in the Elizabethan age
we have the gallant cocking up one side of his broad-brimmed,
high-crowned felt or beaver and securing
<span class="sidenote"><i>The 18th century.</i></span>
it with a jewel. Brims were as wide at the end of the
17th century, but the crown was lower. From the French court
came the fashion of cocking up three sides, one at least being
fastened with a loop of ribbon from which developed the cockade.
A black cockade became the sign of a military man in England
before 1750, and the same ornament, highly conventionalized,
is now at the side of the tall hats worn by the grooms and coachmen
of military and naval officers. Following varying fashions,
the 18th-century cocked hat was laced with gold and silver or
edged with feathers. It was cocked in a hundred forms, from
that which has three sides slightly curled upward to the great
Khevenhueller cock, wherewith a very wide-brimmed hat was
flapped up at the front and rear, a military or martial hat. Wigs,
worn by all the upper- and middle-class men, were generally
powdered, but the lesser or Ramillie wig soon drove out the huge
and costly full-bottomed periwig, even for ceremonial occasions.
Of Lord Bolingbroke it is told that he once attended Queen Anne
in haste with a tie or Ramillie wig on his head. Her Majesty showed
her displeasure by remarking that his lordship would next come
to court in a night-cap. Nevertheless, the tie-wig soon became
court wear, secured at the back with a huge bow of ribbon below
which hung the plaited pigtail, worn waist-long about 1740.
But by that time young bloods were leaving campaign-wigs
for the bob-wig which sat yet more closely to the head, the
curls leaving the neck uncovered. Bag-wigs, found early in
the century, covered the looped up pigtail in a black silk bag.
Clergymen and grave physicians affected the full-bottomed wig
after it became old fashioned. Subject
to slight changes, eagerly followed by the
beaux and mocked by the satirists, the
habit of well-dressed men shows no
great variety&mdash;the large-cuffed, collarless
coats whose full skirts are now
shortened, now lengthened, the long
waistcoat to match, the closely fitting
breeches, the stockings, the shoes and
jack-boots. The coat tends to be
thrown open to show the waistcoat,
upon which brocade and embroideries
were lavished. Stockings, until the
middle of the century, were commonly
drawn over the ends of the breeches
and gartered below the knee. By 1740
the long cravat with hanging ends grows
old fashioned. Young men take to the
solitaire, a black cravat which became
a mere loop of ribbon passed loosely
round the neck and secured to the
black tie of the wig.</p>

<p>George III.&rsquo;s long reign begins with
men&rsquo;s fashions little changed from
those of his great-grandfather&rsquo;s time, although his sixty
years carry us to the beginning of all the modern modes.
The small wig long holds its own. The coat begins to show
the broad skirts cut away diagonally from the waist to the
skirt edge, and stockings are no longer rolled over the knee.
Perhaps the most remarkable fashion was that which distinguished
the Macaronis, travelled exquisites with whom the
wig or long hair was dragged high above the forehead in a tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
&ldquo;toupee&rdquo; with two large rows of curls at the side. This head-dress,
clubbed into a heavy knot behind, was surmounted by a
very little hat. The coat with small cuffs was much cut away
before, the skimped skirts reaching midway down the thigh.
Waistcoat flaps were but little below the waist. Breeches,
striped or spotted like those of a Dresden china shepherd, were
fastened at the knee with a bunch of ribbon ends; a watch-guard
hung from each fob. The shirt-front was frilled and a white
cravat was tied in a great bow at the chin. Macaronis wore a
little curved hanger, or replaced the sword with a long, heavily
tasselled cane, which served to lift the little hat off the topmost
peak of the toupee. The woman-Macaroni wore no hoop but in
full dress. Her gown was a loose wrapper, the sleeves short and
wide with many ruffles, the skirt pulled aside to show a petticoat
laced and embroidered with flowers. But her distinguishing
mark was her head-dress, which exaggerated the male fashion,
towering upward until the flowers and feathers at the top
threatened the candelabra of the assembly room. The Macaronis
appear about 1772 and stay but a short while, for the revolutionary
fashions tread upon their heels.</p>

<p>Women&rsquo;s dress in this 18th century is dominated by the hoop-petticoat
which Sir Roger de Coverley recognizes in 1711 as a
new fashion and an old one
revived. A stiff bodice laced
in front, a gown, with short
and wide-ended sleeves,
gathered up in folds above
the petticoat, a laced apron
and a lace cap with hanging
lappets, is the dress of the
century&rsquo;s beginning. So the
women of fashion are compared
with children in go-carts,
their tight-laced waists
rising from vast bells of
petticoats over which the
gown is looped up like a
drawn curtain. By 1750 the
hoop-petticoat ringed with
whalebone is so vast that
architects begin to allow for
its passage up London stairways
by curving the balusters
outward. Great variety of
women&rsquo;s dress appears under
George II., but those in the
height of the mode affected a shepherdess simplicity in their
walking clothes, wearing the flat-crowned or high-crowned hats
and long aprons of the dairymaid. At this time a new fashion
comes in, the <i>sacque</i>, a gown, sometimes sleeveless, open to the
waist, hanging loosely from the shoulders to near the edge of the
hoop-petticoat. George III.&rsquo;s reign saw women&rsquo;s head-dressings
reach an extravagance of folly passing all that had come before it.
Hair kneaded with pomatum and flour was drawn up over a cushion
or pad of wool, and twisted into curls and knots and decorated
with artificial flowers and bows of ribbon. As this could not be
achieved without the aid of a skilled barber, the &ldquo;head&rdquo; sometimes
remained unopened for several weeks. At the end of that
time sublimate powder was needed to kill off the tenantry which
had multiplied within. At the beginning of the last quarter of
the century the feathers grew larger, chains of beads looped
about the curls, while ships in full sail, coaches and horses, and
butterflies in blown glass, rocked upon the upper heights. Loose
mob-caps or close &ldquo;Joans&rdquo; were worn in undress, often as simple
as the full dress was fantastic. Varieties of the gown and sacque
remained in fashion, the petticoat being still much in evidence,
flounced or quilted, or festooned with ribbons. Before the
&rsquo;eighties of this century were over, a new taste, encouraged by
the painters of the school of Reynolds, began to sweep away
many follies, and the revolutionary fashions of France, breaking
with all that spoke of the old régime, expelled many more. The
age of powder and gold lace, of peach-bloom brocade coats with
muff-shaped cuffs, of bag-wigs and three-cornered hats drew
suddenly to an end. Mr Pitt killed hair-powder by his tax of
1795, but before that time fashionable men, who since the beginning
of George III&rsquo;s. reign had been somewhat inconstant to the
wig, were wearing their own hair unpowdered and tied in a club
at the back of the coat collar. Before the century end the
roughly cropped &ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; head was seen. The wig remained
here and there on some old-fashioned pates. Bishops wore it
until far into the Victorian age, and it may still be seen in the
Houses of Parliament and in the courts of law. Even breeches
were passing, tight pantaloons showing themselves in the streets.
The coat, cut away over the hips, began to take a high collar
and the beginnings of the lappel. Its cuffs were of the modern
shape, showing a narrow ruffle. The waistcoat ended at the
waist. Loose neck-cloths were worn above a frilled shirt-front.
Great jack-boots were given to postillions, and men of fashion
walked the streets in short top-boots of soft black leather. Most
remarkable of the revolutionary changes, the round hat came
back, sometimes in a form which recalled the earlier 17th century,
and at last took shape as the predecessor of our modern silk hat.
Court dresses kept something of their magnificence, but men
at home or in the streets were giving up in this time of change
their ancient right to wear rich and figured stuffs. Laces and
embroideries were henceforward but for military and civil
uniforms.</p>

<p>Before 1790 women had begun to dismantle their high headgear,
returning to nature by way of a frizzled bush, like a bishop&rsquo;s
wig, with a few curls hanging over the shoulders. Over such
heads would be seen towering mob-caps tied with ribbon and
edged deeply with lace. Skirts took a moderate size and even
court hoops were but panniers hung on either side of the hips.
Short jackets with close half-sleeves were worn with the neck
and breast covered with a cambric <i>buffant</i> that borrowed a mode
from the pouter pigeon. A riding habit follows as far as the
short waist the new fashions for men&rsquo;s coats, the wide-brimmed
hat being to match. Short waists came in soon after 1790, the
bodice ending under the arm pits, &ldquo;a petticoat tied round the
neck: the arms put through the pocket-holes.&rdquo; With these
French gowns came small coal-scuttle-shaped bonnets of straw,
hung with many ribbons and decorated with feathers. At last
the woman of fashion, dressed by a Parisian modiste after the
orders of David the painter, gathered her hair in a fillet and
clothed herself in little more than a diaphanous tunic gown
over a light shift and close, flesh-coloured drawers. Her shoes
became sandals: her jewels followed the patterns of old Rome.
Yet the same woman, shivering half-clad in something that
wrapped her less than a modern bathing-dress, appeared at
court in the ancient hoop-skirt, tasselled, ribboned and garlanded,
hung with heavy swags of coloured silk, and this until George
IV. at last broke the antique order by a special command.</p>

<p>The 19th century soon made an end of 18th century fashions
already discredited by the revolutionary spirit. The three-cornered
hat had gone, the heavy coat cuff and the
cravat with hanging ends. Civilians had given up the
<span class="sidenote">19th century.</span>
ancient custom of going armed with a sword. The wig
and even the pigtail tied with black shalloon were abandoned by
all but a few old folk. Soldiers cut off their pigtails in 1808.
But judges and lawyers wear their wigs in court in the 20th
century, state coachmen wear them on the box, and physicians
and the higher clergy wore them even in the street long after
laymen had given them up. George IV. refused to receive a
bishop of London who appeared at court without a wig, and
Sumner, archbishop of Canterbury, wore one until his death in
1862. A few powdered heads were seen as late as the &rsquo;forties.
M. de Ste Aulaire, the ambassador, made, as Lord Palmerston
writes, a very deep and general impression in London society of
1841, not because he wore hair-powder but because he used so
much of it. It is now used only by a few lacqueys. In the early
Victorian period the cropped &ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; head was out of
fashion, many men wearing their hair rather long and so freely
oiled that the &ldquo;anti-macassar&rdquo; came in to protect drawing-room
chair-backs.</p>

<p>With powdered hair and the pigtail passed away the 18th
century cloth breeches. Here again some old-fashioned people
made a stand against the change, the opposition of the clergy
being commemorated in the black breeches still worn by bishops
and other dignitaries of the church. But in the regent&rsquo;s time
pantaloons of closely fitting and elastic cloth were worn with
low shoes or Hessians, and pantaloons and Hessians did not
utterly disappear from the streets until the end of the &rsquo;fifties.
Squires and sportsmen put on buckskins of an amazing tightness
and walked the street in top-boots. But the loose Cossack
trousers soon made their appearance. The regent&rsquo;s influence
made the blue coat with a very high velvet collar, a high-waisted
Marcella waistcoat and white duck trousers strapped under the
instep, a mode in which men even ventured to appear at evening
receptions, although, in the year before Waterloo, the duke of
Wellington was refused admittance to Almack&rsquo;s when thus clad.
Long skirted overcoats, fur-collared and tight in the waist,
completed this costume. Coats were blue, claret, buff and brown.
&ldquo;Pea-green Hayne&rdquo; was known among clubmen by a brighter
coloured garment. Civilians, like Jos Sedley, would sometimes
affect a frock frogged and braided in semi-military fashion.
The shirt collar turned upward, the points showing above vast
cravats whose careful arrangement
was maintained by one or two scarf-pins.
Brummel the master dandy
of his age, may be called the first
dandy of the modern school. Dressing,
as a rule, in black, he distinguished
himself, not as the bucks of
an earlier age by bright colours, rich
materials or jewellery, but by his
extravagant neatness and by the
superb fit of garments which set the
fashion for lesser men. To him,
according to Grantley Berkeley, we
owe the modern dress-coat. An idle
phrase in Bulwer-Lytton&rsquo;s <i>Pelham</i>
(1828), that &ldquo;people must be very
distinguished in appearance&rdquo; to look
well in black, made black henceforward
the colour of evening coats
and frock coats. With the perfection
of the silk hat in the &rsquo;thirties,
English costume enters on its last
phase. The coat cut away squarely
in front was then out of the mode;
it remains but in the evening-dress coat now always worn
unbuttoned, and in the dress of the hunting field. The
rest is a record of such slight changes as tailors may cautiously
introduce among customers, no one of whom will dare to
lead a new fashion boldly. For many decades the fashionably
dressed man has been eager to conform to the last authorized
vogue and to lose himself among others as shyly obedient.
The tubular lines of 20th-century clothing advantage the tailor
by the tendency of new clothing to crease at the elbow and
bag at the knee. In preserving the necessary straight lines of
his garments, in following the season&rsquo;s fashions in details which
only an expert eye would mark, and in providing himself with
clothes specialized for every hour of the day, for a score of sports
and for the gradations of social ceremonial&mdash;in these things only
can the modern dandy rival his magnificent predecessors. For
ornament, other than plain shirt studs, a plain seal ring, a simple
watch guard and a rarely-worn scarf pin, is denied him.</p>

<p>Women at the beginning of the 19th century were clad in those
fashions which revolutionary France borrowed from the antique.
The simplicity of this style gave it a certain grace; it was at the
other pole from the absurdity of the court dress which, until
George IV. ordered otherwise, perpetuated the bunched draperies,
the flounces and furbelows and even the hoop of the worst
period of the 18th century. The gown, lightly girdled near the
arm-pits with a tasselled cord, fell in straight clinging folds.
Soft muslin was the favourite material, and in muslin fashionable
women faced the winter winds, protected only by the long
pelisses which in summer were replaced by short spencers.
Turbans, varying from a light headscarf of lace or muslin to a
velvet confection like that of a Turk on a signboard, were the
favourite headgear, although bonnets, hats and caps are found in
a hundred shapes. Muslin handkerchiefs or small ruffs were worn
about the neck in the morning dress. About the Waterloo period
the elegance of the classical gown disappeared. The waist was
still high at first but the gown was shorter and wider at the skirt.
For evening dress these skirts were stiffened with buckram and
trimmed with much tasteless trumpery. Large bonnets were
common, and the hair was dragged stiffly to the back of the head,
to be secured by a large comb. From 1830 begins a period of
singular ugliness. Tight stays came back again, the skirt swept
the pavements, a generation of over-clad matrons seemed to
have followed a generation of nymphs. The &rsquo;fifties showed even
more barbarous devices, and about 1854 came in from France the
crinoline, that strange revival of the ancient hoop. Plaids,
checks and bars, bright blues, crude violets and hideous crimsons,
were seen in French merinos, Irish poplins and English alpacas.
Women in short jackets, hooped skirts, hideous bonnets and
shawls seemed to have banished their youth. The empress
Eugénie, a leader of European fashion, decreed that white muslin
should be the evening mode, and at balls, where the steels and
whalebones of the crinoline were impossible, the women swelled
their skirts by wearing a dozen or fourteen muslin petticoats at
once. Towards the end of the &rsquo;sixties the crinolines disappeared
as suddenly as they came, and by 1875 skirts were so tight at the
knees that walking upstairs in them was an affair of deliberation.
Before 1880 dress-reformers and aesthetes had attacked on two
sides the fashions which had halted at the &ldquo;Princesse&rdquo; robe,
draped and kilted. Both movements failed, but left marked
effects. From that time fashion has been less blindly followed,
and women have enjoyed some limited individual freedom in
designing their costumes. Of 20th-century fashions it is most
notable that they change year by year with mechanical regularity.
The clothes of smart women can no longer be said to
express any tendency of an age. Year by year the modes are
deliberately altered by a conclave of the great <i>modistes</i> whose
desire is less to produce rich or beautiful garments than to make
that radical alteration from loose sleeve to tight sleeve, from
draped skirt to plain skirt, which will force every women to cast
aside the last season&rsquo;s garments and buy those of the newer
device. But of modern dress it may at least be said that cheaper
materials, the sewing machine and the popular fashion papers
allow women of the humbler classes to dress more decently and
tastefully. Their dress is no longer that frowsy parody of
richer women&rsquo;s frippery which shocked observant foreigners a
generation ago.</p>

<p><i>Underclothing.</i>&mdash;Of the underclothing worn next the skin
something may be said apart from the general history of costume.
Linen shirts were worn by both men and women in the age before
the Conquest, and even in the 10th century it was a penance to
wear a woollen one. After that time we soon hear of embroidery
and ornament applied to them, presumably at the collar which
would be visible above gown or tunic. Men added short drawers,
or breeches, a word which does not secure its modern value until
the end of the 16th century. &ldquo;Drawers&rdquo; signified various
descriptions of overall, Cotgrave explaining the word as coarse
stockings drawn over others although Randle Holme gives it in
its later sense. Isaac of Cyprus is named by Robert of Brunne as
escaping &ldquo;bare in his serke and breke.&rdquo; Henry Christall, who
brought four Irish kings to London, told Froissart how, finding
that they wore no breeches, he bought linen cloth for them.
Medieval romances and the like give us the choice of shirts of
linen, of fine Holland, of cloth of Rennes and even of silk, and
Chaucer speaks of women&rsquo;s smocks wrought with silk, embroidered
behind and before. Poorer folk went, like Thynne&rsquo;s
poor countryman, in shirts of &ldquo;canvas hard and tough,&rdquo; or
of coarse Breton dowlas. Under the first Tudors, shirts are
decorated with gold, silk and black thread embroideries, the
latter being seen in the ruffled shirt worn by the earl of Surrey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
in our illustration (see fig. 38). Stubbes, in his often-quoted
<i>Anatomie of Abuses</i> (1583) declaims against the extravagant
sums spent in shirts, the meanest of which would cost a crown or
a noble, while the most curiously
stitched were valued at ten
pounds a piece, &ldquo;which is
horrible to hear.&rdquo; The Puritans,
many of whom, like the later
Clapham sect, were careful of
intimate luxuries, had a curious
fashion of wearing shirts and
smocks worked with &ldquo;holy embroideries,&rdquo;
Biblical sentences or
figures, which recall a similar
custom among the early
Christians. At this time underclothing
had increased in quantity,
for there are many indications
that the men and women of
the middle ages were often
content with a bare change of
linen at the best. <i>The Book of
Courtesy</i> (temp. Hen. VII.) orders
the servant to provide &ldquo;clene
sherte and breche&rdquo; against his
master&rsquo;s uprising, but the
laundering of the linen of the
Percy household, a hundred and
seventy people, costs but forty shillings a year in the reign of
Henry VIII.</p>

a Man in a Shirt (early 14th century). From Royal MS. 19 B. xv.</td></tr></table>

<p>With that modern period of dress which may be said to begin
with the Restoration, shirts increased in number. Women shifted
their smocks when coming in from field sports, fine gentlemen
became proud of the number of their shirts, as was that 18th-century
lord who boasted to Casanova of his changing a shirt
several times in the day, his chin being shaved on each occasion.
A valuable document concerning the underclothing worn by a
citizen in the reign of Charles II. is afforded by the evidence of
the man who helped to strip the body of the suicide Sir Edmond
Berry Godfrey. &ldquo;I pulled off his shoes,&rdquo; says Fisher, &ldquo;three
pairs of stockings and a pair of socks, his black breeches and his
drawers.&rdquo; His coat and waistcoat, his shirt and his flannel shirt
are also named. The knight came by his end on an October day.
He was therefore warmly clad. His three pair of stockings will be
noted: two pair are worn at the present day by most men in
court dress. The socks are a rarely named addition, and the
flannel shirt may be remarked. Loose ruffles of lace were
attached to shirt cuffs until during the great part of the 18th
century, and the ruffled or goffered shirt-front, which became
common under George III., continued in use in the early Victorian
period, the stiffly starched shirt-front taking its place at last even
in evening dress. The last quarter of the 19th century, breaking
through the strange mock-modesty which spoke of breeches as
&ldquo;inexpressibles,&rdquo; saw the question of hygienic underclothing
a subject much in debate, and now most men other than the
poorer sort wear, besides the shirt, a light woollen vest and short
drawers or long pantaloons of wool or wool&rsquo;s counterfeit. Woollen
shirts are worn by bicyclists, cricketers and tennis players. In
morning dress the inconvenience of the starched shirt-front is
commonly avoided. A goffered shirt-front worn with evening
dress is the mark of a foreigner in London, but some few men
venture to clothe themselves for the evening in a shirt whose front
is pleated and but slightly starched. Loose collars, formerly
known as false collars, descendants of the Puritan&rsquo;s &ldquo;plain
band,&rdquo; have been attached to the shirt by studs at least for the
last fifty years. Their fashions often change, but the older type
turned down at the edge is not often seen. To women&rsquo;s underclothing
drawers have been added in the 19th century. Brantôme,
writing in the 16th, speaks of this garment as then lately introduced
since the time of Henri II., but the fashion, apparently,
did not long endure in France. In England they are noted as in
occasional use at the Restoration. After 1820 a sort of trouser
with a frilled edge was worn for a time by fashionable women in
England. The pantalette which afterwards appears in pictures
of young girls was a mere legging fastened by tapes above the
knees. Many women of the better class only adopted drawers at
the end of the &rsquo;forties, and it may be presumed that the fashion
reached the humble sort at a much later date. Towards the end
of the 19th century both drawers and smock or &ldquo;chemise&rdquo;
were commonly exchanged for a more convenient &ldquo;combination
garment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>European Fashions.</i>&mdash;Race, climate, poverty and wealth have
all had their part in the fashion of clothing. A mountaineer is not
clad as a lowlander; the Tirolese in
his short breeches, the Highlanders of
Scotland and Albania in their tartan
or white linen kilts go with uncovered
knees. The Russian moujik in winter
has his frowsy sheepskin coat, and the
Russian prince imitates it in costly
furs. While the rich man&rsquo;s clothing
alters with every fancy of the tailors,
the poor man&rsquo;s garments, fewer and
cheaper, change slowly in the ages.
An old Lincolnshire peasant wearing
his smock frock and leathern gaiters
might pass unnoted in a peasant crowd
of centuries ago. Here and there in
Europe we find in the 20th century a
peasantry in whose clothing fashion
seems to have been suddenly stayed.
A Breton peasant in his holiday dress
gives us a man of the late 17th century,
even as an Irish peasant may keep the
breeches, shoes and tailed coat of the
early 19th. But the old fashions are
passing from Europe: the sewing
machine and the railway sweep before
them the pleasant provincialisms of
dress. A shirt with the bosom heavily embroidered, a skirt
with a year&rsquo;s stitching in the hem are not to be imitated by
the dealer in ready-made clothing, who offers, instead, cheapness
and the brisk variety of the town. Old writers, each in
turn, set up their wail that the time was come when you
could not tell Jack from his master, the burgess from the knight.
And now that time has come in some sort, for the town dress of
the richer classes of London or Paris is imitated by all peoples
and by rich and poor. Especially is this the case in England
where the clean and honourable blouse of the French workman is
not, a journeyman painter or labourer often going to his work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
in a frayed and greasy morning coat after the cut of that in which
a rich man will pay a London morning call. English fashions for
men are followed in Paris. London women follow the modes of
the rue de la Paix. Berlin tailors and dressmakers laboriously
misapprehend both styles. To those who do not understand the
international trafficking of the middle ages and the age of
renascence it is strange to note how little the fashions varied in
European lands. All kinds of folks, crusaders and merchants,
diplomatists and religious, carried between nation and nation the
news of the latest cut of the shears.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, national character touched each nation&rsquo;s dress&mdash;the
Venetian loving the stateliness of flowing line, the Germans
grotesque slashings and jaggings. Frenchmen, says Randle
Holme in the 17th century, keep warm and muff themselves in
cold weather, &ldquo;but in summer through fantastical dresses go
almost naked.&rdquo; For the same writer the Spaniard was noted as a
man in a high-crowned hat with narrow brim, a ruff about his
neck, a doublet with short and narrow skirts and broad wings at
the shoulders, ruff-cuffs at his hands, breeches narrow and close
to his thighs, hose gartered, shoes with rounded toes, a short
cloak and a long sword. In all of those points we may take it
that the Spaniard differed from the Englishman as observed by
this observant one. Even in our own days we may catch
something of those national fashions. The Spaniard may no
longer walk with his long sword, his ruff and gartered hose,
but he keeps his fancy for sombre blacks, and so do the citizens of
those Netherlands which he once ruled.</p>
<div class="author">(O. Ba.)</div>

<p class="center pt2 sc">III. National and Class Costume</p>

<p>Costume, as readers of Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Sartor Resartus</i> know, always
has a significance deeper than the mere whims of fashion. In
the cosmopolitan society of modern times dress everywhere
tends to become assimilated to a common model, and this
assimilation, however regrettable from the picturesque point of
view, is one of the most potent forces in the break-down of the
traditional social distinctions. In the middle ages in Europe,
and indeed down to the French Revolution, the various classes
of the community were clearly differentiated by their dress.
Everywhere, of course, it happened that occasionally jackdaws
strutted in peacock&rsquo;s feathers; but even in England, where class
distinctions were early less clearly marked than on the continent
of Europe, the assumption of a laced coat and a sword marked
the development of a citizen into a &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; (q.v.). Nothing
has more powerfully contributed to the social amalgamation of
the &ldquo;upper-middle&rdquo; and the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; classes in England than
the fashion, introduced in the 19th century, of extreme simplicity
in the costume of men. But, apart from the properties of
richness in material or decoration as a symbol of class distinction&mdash;at
one time enforced by sumptuary laws&mdash;there have been,
and still are, innumerable varieties of costume more or less
traditional as proper to certain nationalities or certain classes
within those nationalities. Of national costumes properly so
called the best known to the English-speaking world is that of the
Highlands of Scotland. This is, indeed no longer generally worn,
being usually confined to gentlemen of birth and their dependents,
but it remains a national dress and is officially recognized as such
by the English court and in the uniforms of the Highland
regiments in the British army. The chief peculiarity of this
costume, distinguishing it from any others, is the tartan, an
arrangement of a prevailing colour with more or less narrow
checks of other colours, by which the various clans or septs of the
same race can be distinguished, while a certain general uniformity
symbolizes the union of the clans in a common nationality.
Thus, e.g. the tartan of the clan McDonell is green with narrow
checks of red, that of the clan Gregarach red with narrow checks
of black. The costume consists of a short tunic, vest, a kilt&mdash;heavily
pleated&mdash;fastened round the waist, and reaching not
quite to the knees (like a short petticoat), stockings gartered
below the bare knee, and shoes. In front of the person, hanging
from a belt round the waist, is the &ldquo;sporran&rdquo; or &ldquo;spleuchan,&rdquo; a
pocket-purse covered with fur; and a large &ldquo;plaid&rdquo; or scarf,
usually wrapped round the body, the ends hanging down from a
brooch fastened on the left shoulder, but sometimes gathered up
and hanging from the brooch behind, completes the costume.
The head-gear is a cloth cap or &ldquo;bonnet,&rdquo; in which a sprig of
heather is stuck, or an eagle&rsquo;s feather in the case of chiefs. A
dirk is worn thrust into the right stocking. Up to the end of the
16th century the tunic and &ldquo;philibeg&rdquo; or kilt formed a single
garment; but otherwise the costume has come down the ages
without sensible modification. Kilt and plaid are of tartan; and
sometimes tartan &ldquo;trews,&rdquo; i.e. trousers, are substituted for the
former.</p>

<p>Among other national costumes still surviving in Europe may
be mentioned the Albanian-Greek dress (characterized by the
spreading, pleated white kilt, or <i>fustanella</i>), and the splendid
full-dress of a Hungarian gentleman, the prototype of the well-known
hussar uniform; to which may be added the Tirolese
costume, which, so far as the men are concerned, is characterized
by short trousers, cut off above the knee, and a short jacket, the
colour varying in different districts. This latter trait illustrates
the fact that most of the still surviving &ldquo;national&rdquo; costumes in
Europe are in fact local and distinctive of class, though they
conform to a national type. These &ldquo;folk-costumes&rdquo; (<i>Volkstrachten</i>),
as the Germans call them, survive most strongly in the
most conservative of all classes, that of the peasants and naturally
mainly in those districts least accessible to modern &ldquo;enterprise.&rdquo;
These peasant costumes, often of astonishing richness and
beauty, vary more or less in every village, each community
having its own traditional type; and, since this type does not
vary, they can be handed down as valuable heirlooms from
father to son and from mother to daughter. But they are fast
disappearing. In the British islands, where there were no free
peasant cultivators to maintain the pride of class, they vanished
long since; the white caps and steeple-crowned hats of Welsh
women were the last to go; and even the becoming and convenient
&ldquo;sun bonnet,&rdquo; which survives in the United States, has
given place almost everywhere to the hideous &ldquo;cloth cap&rdquo; of
commerce; while the ancient smocked frock, the equivalent of
the French peasant&rsquo;s workmanlike <i>blouse</i>, has become a curiosity.
The same process is proceeding elsewhere; for the simple
peasant women cannot resist the blandishments of the commercial
traveller and the temptation of change and cheap finery. The
transition is at once painful and amusing, and not without interest
as illustrating the force of tradition in its struggle with fashion;
for it is no uncommon thing, e.g. in France or Holland, to see a
&ldquo;Paris model&rdquo; perched lamentably on the top of the beautiful
traditional head-dress. Similarly in the richer Turkish families
women are rapidly acquiring a taste for Parisian costumes,
frequently worn in absurd combination with their ordinary
garments.</p>

<p>The same process has extended far beyond the limits of
Europe. Improved communication and industrial enterprise
have combined with the prestige of European civilization to
commend the European type of costume to peoples for whom
it is eminently unsuited. Even the peoples of the East, whose
costume has remained unchanged for untold centuries, and for
whom the type has been (as in India) often determined by
religious considerations, are showing an increasing tendency to
yield to the world-fashion. Turkey, as being most closely in
touch with Europe, was the first to feel the influence; the introduction
of the fez and the frock-coat, in place of the large turban
and flowing caftan of the old Turk, was the most conspicuous of
the reforms of Sultan Mahmud II.; and when, in 1909, the first
Turkish parliament met, only a small minority of its members
wore their traditional costumes. The introduction of Japan into
the comity of nations was followed by the adoption of European
costume by the court and the upper classes, at least in public
and on ceremonial occasions; in private the wide-sleeved, loose,
comfortable <i>kimono</i> continues to be worn. China, on the other
hand, has been more conservative, even her envoys in Europe
preserving intact (except sometimes in the matter of boots) the
traditional costume of their nation and class, while those of
Japan, Corea and Siam appear in the conventional diplomatic or
&ldquo;evening&rdquo; dress in Europe. In the Mussulman East, even when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
European dress has been adopted, an exception has usually been
made in favour of head-gear, which has a special religious
significance. In Turkey, for instance, the hat has not succeeded
in displacing the fez; and in India, though the Parsis had by the
beginning of the 20th century begun to modify their traditional
high turban-like hat into a modified &ldquo;bowler,&rdquo; and Hindus&mdash;abroad
at least&mdash;were affecting the head-gear of the West, those
Mussulman princes who had adopted, wholly or partially,
European dress continued to wear the turban. On the other
hand, the amir of Afghanistan, when he visited India, had&mdash;out of

In spite of the natural conservatism, strengthened by religious
conventions, of the Eastern races, there is a growing danger that
the spread of European enlightenment will more or less rapidly
destroy that picturesque variety of costume which is the delight
of the traveller and the artist. For Indian costumes see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">India</a></span>:

<p class="center pt2 sc">IV. Official Costume</p>

<p>Official costumes, in so far as they are not, like the crowns and
tabards of heralds, the coronets of peers, or the gold keys tacked
to the coat-tails of royal chamberlains&mdash;consciously symbolical,
are for the most part ceremonious survivals of bygone general
fashions. This is as true of the official costume of the past as of
the present; as may be illustrated from ancient Rome, where
the toga, once the general costume of Roman citizens, in the 3rd
and 4th centuries was the official robe of senators and officials
(see also under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestments</a></span>). Thus, at the present time, the lay
chamberlains of the pope and the members of his Swiss guard
wear costumes of the 16th century, and the same is true of the
king&rsquo;s yeomen of the guard in England. In general, however
(apart from robes, which are much older in their origin), official
costumes in Europe, or in countries of European origin, are
based on the fashions of the 18th and early 19th centuries.
Knee-breeches, however, which survive in the full-dress of many
British officials, as in ordinary court dress, had practically
disappeared on the continent of Europe, surviving only in certain
peasant costumes, when the emperor William II. reintroduced
them at the court of Berlin. The tendency in the modern
democratic communities of Anglo-Saxon race has been to dispense
with official costumes. In the United States the judges of the
Supreme Court alone wear robes; the president of the Republic
wears on all occasions the dress of an ordinary citizen, unrelieved
by order or decoration, and thus symbolizes his pride of place as
<i>primus inter pares</i>; an American ambassador appears on state
occasions among his colleagues, gorgeous in bullion-covered
coats, in the ordinary black &ldquo;evening dress&rdquo; of a modern
gentleman. The principle, which tends to assert itself also in the
autonomous &ldquo;British dominions beyond the seas,&rdquo; is not the
result of that native dislike of &ldquo;dressing up&rdquo; which characterizes
many Englishmen of the upper and middle classes; for modern
democracy shares to the full the taste of past ages for official or
quasi-official finery, as is proved by the costumes and insignia of
the multitudinous popular orders, Knights Templars, Foresters,
Oddfellows and the like. It is rather cherished as the outward
and visible sign of that doctrine of the equality of all men which
remains the most generally gratifying of the gifts of French
18th-century philosophy to the world. In Great Britain, where
equality has ever been less valued than liberty, official costumes
have tended to increase rather than to fall into disuse; mayors of
new boroughs, for instance, are not considered properly equipped
until they have their gown and chain of office. In France, on the
other hand, the taste of the people for pomp and display, and, it
may be added, their innate artistic sense, have combined with
their passion for equality to produce a somewhat anomalous
situation as regards official costume. Lawyers have their robes,
judges their scarlet gowns, diplomatists their gold-laced uniforms;
but the state costume of the president of the Republic
is &ldquo;evening dress,&rdquo; relieved only by the red riband and star of the
Legion of Honour. In the Latin states of South America, which
tend to be disguised despotisms rather than democracies, the
actual rather than the theoretical state of things is symbolized
by the gorgeous official uniforms which are among the rewards of
those who help the dictator for the time being to power. See also

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;Apart from the enormous number of books
especially devoted to costume, innumerable illustrated works exist
which are, in various degrees, useful for the study of the history of
this subject. It may be noted here, e.g. that the illuminators and
painters of the middle ages did not affect historical accuracy in their
presentment of biblical or secular subjects, but clothed their patriarchs,
apostles or Roman warriors in the dress of their own ages,
their pictures thus becoming invaluable records of the costume of
their time. In this respect the knowledge of classical antiquity
revived during the Renaissance introduced a certain confusion.
Artists began to realize the incongruity of representing antique
figures in modern garb, but, in the absence of exact knowledge,
fancy began to play a greater part than research in the dressing
of their characters. Portraits and representations of contemporary
scenes (e.g. Rembrandt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Night Watch&rdquo;) continue to be first-hand
authorities for the costume of the period in which they were produced;
but representations of biblical or historical scenes have
little or no value from this point of view. Thus in Rubens&rsquo;s famous
picture of St Ambrose repelling Theodosius from the door of his
cathedral, the bishop is vested in the mitre and cope which only
came into vogue centuries later, while the emperor wears a military
costume modelled on that of Roman imperators of an earlier day.
Even in portraiture, however, a certain conservatism tends to make
the record untrustworthy; thus, great men continued to be painted
in full armour long after it had in fact ceased to be worn.</p>
